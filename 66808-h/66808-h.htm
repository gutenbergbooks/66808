THE HIGHLANDERS OF GLEN ORA.

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
THE FOSTER-BROTHERS.
</h3>

<p>
It was after sunset in the month of April three years
ago.
</p>

<p>
The hills of the Western Highlands were still
tipped with a golden gleam, but the deep and savage
hollows of Glen Ora were gloomy and full of dark
shadows.  Still crowned with the snow of last winter,
above it towered Ben Ora, beneath whose mighty
scalp the giant peaks of the north and west were
dwindled down to little hills; for among those
stupendous mountains the eye becomes so accustomed
to their colossal proportions, that all just ideas of size
and distance are lost.  At its base spread one of those
vast tracts of brown or purple heath so common in
the Scottish Highlands, overspread by a wilderness of
stones, and torn by ghastly ravines from which the
mist of downward torrents rose.  The sides of these
were tufted by those black whin bushes, the
introduction of which tradition ascribes to the hunting
Stuarts, as a cover for their game.
</p>

<p>
On the western shoulder of Ben Ora, a ridge of
riven and naked rocks, resembling the skeleton of a
mountain range, stood a herd of deer, with all their
proud antlers visible against the clear bright flush of
the sunset sky.
</p>

<p>
Two men were observing them from the rugged
bank of one of the watercourses, in which they were
half hidden.  One carried a fishing-rod, and the other
a gun.
</p>

<p>
He with the rod was a tall, stout, and well-made lad
of some twenty years, with dark-blue eyes, curly
brown hair, and a sunburnt visage; he wore a grey
shooting-jacket and kilt, a sporran, of badger-skin, and
a heather-coloured bonnet.  His companion was a few
years older, larger in form, brawny, thickset, and
strong as a Highland bull, and his knees, where
shown by his tattered kilt and well-worn hose, of no
colour known in nature, were almost as hairy as those
of the same animal.  He wore the usual coarse blue
jacket and bonnet of a Highland peasant.
</p>

<p>
His hair, beard, and whiskers, which grew all
matted in a curly mass, were black, almost to that
deep tint which seems blue when touched by the
light; his eyes were dark, restless, keen, and sparkling;
his nose somewhat short and saucy, but his face,
which was browned to the hue of mahogany by exposure
to the weather, was thoughtful, stern, anxious,
and at times even haggard in expression.  Save his
gun and skene-dhu, he had no weapon, though his
aspect and bearing were rough and wild as those of
any Celtic bandit we have read of in romance; but
then his figure was a model of manly beauty,
symmetry, and grace.
</p>

<p>
The first personage with the red was Allan Mac
Innon, MYSELF, and the dark and handsome man was
my foster-brother&mdash;-my <i>co-dhalta</i>&mdash;Black Mac
Ian&mdash;usually named by us Callum Dhu, and on this eventful
evening we were observing a party of five English
tourists or visitors, who were somewhat rashly (as
they were without a guide) urging their shaggy
shelties up the side of Ben Ora, to obtain a view of
the scenery by moonlight.
</p>

<p>
This party consisted of two fair and laughing
English girls, wearing broad brown straw hats; and
three gentlemen clad in those peculiar coats and
tartan caps, without which no Sassenach deems
himself eligible to pass the Highland frontier.
</p>

<p>
'Callum,' said I, 'shall I net warn them to beware?'
</p>

<p>
'It would ill become your father's son to run after
<i>their</i> tails, like a keeper or gilly,' said he, grasping
my arm angrily, as we spoke in Gaelic, to give the
original of which would fidget my friend the printer.
</p>

<p>
'Callum, they are not more than half-a-mile off
now.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, what a pity it is, that the half-mile was not a
thousand, ay, or ten thousand!  The fires that may
be extinguished this summer on many a hearth in
Glen Ora would burn all the brighter perhaps in
winter.'
</p>

<p>
'Not in the least, Callum; for if we had not one
truculent tyrant over us,' said I, 'we would be certain
to have another.'
</p>

<p>
'Aich ay; for the Mac Innons of Glen Ora are
doomed men! and&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'See, see,' I exclaimed, 'they have almost reached
the Craig-na-tuirc, and if they attempt to descend
after nightfall, something terrible will happen.'
</p>

<p>
'Let it happen: if it is their fate, can we avert it?'
said Callum, with a dark scowl in his eyes which
sparkled in the last flush of the west; 'what matter
is it to you, Allan Mac Innon?  Has not this man&mdash;this
Horace Everingham, Baronet, and so forth, who
bought the fair patrimony your father's brother
wasted in all manner of riotous living&mdash;told you
coldly, when begging a six months' mercy for your
sick mother, and for the two-and-thirty poor families
in the glen, that he intrusted all such petty affairs to
his factor, (that mangy Lowland cur, Ephraim
Snaggs, with his Bible phrases and pious quotations,)
and what said <i>he</i>?  That the new proprietor had
resolved to turn the glen into a deer forest&mdash;-a hunting
field&mdash;and that whether the rents were forthcoming
or not, the people must go!  That Canada was a fine
place for such as they, and that hampers of foreign
game would soon replace them.  The curse of heaven
be on his foreign game, say I!  When the Queen
wants men to recruit the ranks of the Black Watch,
of the Gordon Highlanders, and the Ross-shire Buffs,
will she borrow the contents of the Lowlander's
hamper?  Let these moonlight visitors go over the
rocks if they will&mdash;let Loch Ora receive their bodies
and the devil their souls, for what matters it to you,
Mac Innon, or to me?'
</p>

<p>
'True, true,' said I, bitterly, 'but there are two
ladies with them&mdash;Laura, the daughter of Sir Horace,
and her friend.'
</p>

<p>
'They, at least, are kind to the poor people, and
gave many a pound to the women of Glentuirc, when
they were expatriated last year; yet evil comes over
every stranger who crosses Ben Ora.'
</p>

<p>
'A spirit is said to haunt it,' said I.
</p>

<p>
'Would to heaven a spirit haunted the glen, and
kept out all but those whose right comes not from
paper or from parchment&mdash;but from the hand of
God!'
</p>

<p>
'But the women, Callum?'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Co-dhalta</i>, be not a soft-hearted fool,' was the
pettish response; 'who cared for <i>our</i> women, when
the sheriff, Mac Fee, with his police and soldiers,
came here and tore down the huts, and fired through
the thatch to force the people out?  Who cared for
old bedridden Aileen Mac Donuil, whose four sons
died with eight hundred of our Cameronians in India,
and who was shot through the body, and died miserably
on the wet hill side three days after?  And so,
forth were they all driven to the shore by the baton
and bayonet&mdash;the old and the young, the strong man
and the infant, the aged, the frail, and the women
almost in labour&mdash;to be crammed on board the great
ship, the <i>Duchess</i>, and taken to America, like slaves
from Africa, and why?  Because the land that gave
corn and potatoes to the people was wanted to fatten
the grouse and red deer, and thus were they driven
forth from their fathers' holdings, their fathers' homes
and graves; so Allan, believe me, your sympathy for
the strangers who are now on the hill, is all
moonshine in the water.  Ha! ha! something always
happens to those who go up Ben Ora after nightfall.
You remember the story of Alaster Grant, the Captain
Dhu, or Black Alexander from Urquhart?  He was a
frightfully immoral character, savage and fierce, and
was said to have done dreadful things in the Indian
wars, fighting, plundering, and sparing neither man,
woman, nor child.  Well, this dissolute soldier was
shooting with some of his wild companions from Fort
William, about a year after Waterloo.  They spent a
night on Ben Ora, and all that night the lightning
played about its scalp.  Next morning a shepherd&mdash;old
Alisdair Mac Gouran&mdash;found their hut torn to
pieces; the whole party, to all appearance, strangled,
their gun-barrels twisted like corkscrews, and the
Black Captain's body torn limb from limb, and strewed
all around; but whether by a thunderbolt or the
devil, no man knew, though many averred it must
have been the latter.  Six months ago, I watched an
Englishman or a Lowlander, (which, I neither know
nor care,) go up the Craig-na-tuirc, and he never more
came down; but three months after, his bones, or
little more, were found at the mouth of the Uisc Dhu,
with his travelling knapsack and sketch-book close
by; for six long miles the Lammas floods had swept
them from the spot where he must have perished.
Two others went up in October, and in ascending the
mountain were singing merrily; but the snow came
down that night, and hid the path; the cold was
bitter, and the deer were driven down to the clachan
in the glen.  Next day we found the strangers stiff
enough, and piled a cairn to mark the spot.  I warned
another traveller, a Scotsman too, from the Braes of
Angus, against ascending the Ben alone!  He, too,
went up laughing, and came down no more.  A week
or two after I was standing on the brow of the
Craig-na-tuirc, and saw a gathering of the ravens in
the corrie below.  I heard their exulting croak, and
the flap of their dusky wings; and there, in the moss
of the wet ravine, we found the traveller's body
wedged up to the neck, and his bare skull divested of
eyes, nose, and hair, picked white and clean by these
birds of evil omen.  Then we all know the story of
the keeper that was gored by the white stag, on the
night your father died.'
</p>

<p>
'All this I know well enough,' said I, 'and hence
my anxiety for the two ladies, who are now in the
dusk, ascending that dangerous precipice.'
</p>

<p>
'Who pities our women&mdash;yet they are starving?'
</p>

<p>
'God pities them.'
</p>

<p>
'He alone!' responded Callum, lifting his tattered
bonnet at the name; 'yet my poor mother died in
my arms of sheer hunger, and Snaggs, the factor,
mocked me at her funeral, because I had a piper who
played the march of Gil Chriosd before her coffin; but
I heard him with scorn, for I knew that my mother&mdash;she
who nursed you, Allan Mac Innon, had now that
inheritance of which not even her Grace of Sutherland,
or the great Lord of Breadalbane, can deprive
the poor Highlander&mdash;a grave on the mountain side,
and a home among the angels in heaven.'
</p>

<p>
The words of my foster-brother raised a momentary
glow of indignation in my breast; and turning away
from the mountain, we began to descend into the glen
in the twilight, and I strove to think no more about
the strangers or their fate, but in vain, for Laura
Everingham, with all her pretty winning ways, was
still before me, and her voice was in my ear.
</p>

<p>
We had met repeatedly in our mutual rides, rambles,
and wanderings, and the impression she made
upon me, when acting as her guide to the old ruined
chapels, towers, and burial-places, the high cascades,
and deep corries of the Ora, and other solemn scenes
of nature, with which our district abounded, was
lasting, pure, and deep.  I was learning to love her,
more dearly than I dared to tell, for poverty&mdash;crushing,
grinding poverty&mdash;like a mountain weighed upon
my heart and tongue; yet Laura knew my secret&mdash;at
least I hoped so; pure devotion and true tenderness
cannot remain long concealed; a woman soon
discovers them by a mysterious intuition, and as
Laura (knowing this) neither repulsed nor shunned
me, was I not justified in believing myself not
altogether indifferent to her?
</p>

<p>
Time will tell.  'Happy age,' says some Italian
writer, 'when a look, the rustle of a garment&mdash;a
flower&mdash;a mere nothing, suffice to make the youthful
heart overflow with torrents of joy!'
</p>

<p>
The severity of Sir Horace, and the pride, petulance,
and hostility of my mother, of whom more in
good time, had partly estranged us of late; but Laura
had repeatedly said,
</p>

<p>
'If I knew your mother, Allan, I am sure she
would learn to love me.'
</p>

<p>
'I know not, Miss Everingham, how any one could
help loving you!' was my reply, and I trembled at
my own temerity.
</p>

<p>
One word more for Callum Dhu, and he and my
reader must be acquainted for life.
</p>

<p>
His grandfather was that noble and heroic Mac Ian,
who, after the defeat of Prince Charles, watched over
him with matchless fidelity for weeks, concealing him
in the mountains at the risk of his life, and robbing
for his support while his own children were starving,
and though he knew that 30,000<i>l.</i> were set upon the
head of the royal fugitive.  This poor man was
afterwards, when in extreme old age, hanged at
Inverness, for 'lifting' a sheep; but, though impelled by
hunger to borrow subsistence from the folds of the
wealthy, he had scrupulously avoided the possessions
of the poor; and before death, took off his bonnet,
to 'thank the blessed God that he had never
betrayed his trust, never injured the poor, nor refused
to share his crust with the stranger, the needy, or
the fatherless.'
</p>

<p>
This poor sheepstealer died like a Christian and a
hero, and had in youth been one of those Highland
warriors whose more than Spartan faith and truth a
late pitiful historian has dared to stigmatize as mere
ignorance of the value of gold.  Under the same
circumstances, we presume, this Scottish writer would
have known to a penny the value set upon the head
of his fugitive guest.
</p>

<p>
With his blood and spirit, Callum Dhu had inherited
many of the wild ideas and primitive Celtic
virtues of his ancestor, as the reader will see when
they become better acquainted.

Turning our steps homeward, after a day of wandering
and fishing, we traversed the Braes of Glen Ora,
a wild and desolate scene, such as Horatio Mac
Culloch would love to paint, tufted by broom and whin;
torn by savage watercourses, all yellow marl and
gravel, swept by the foaming torrent, or jagged by
ghastly rocks, silence on every hand, and a deep
shadow over all, save where a golden gleam of light
that shot between the black and distant peaks of the
west, tipped the points of the purple heather with
fire, and edged the scattered rocks with the last glow
of the sun that had set.
</p>

<p>
Here and there, throughout this desolate tract, on
which the shadows of night were descending, were
blacker spots, that marked where, in the preceding
year, the houses of nearly fifty crofters had been
levelled or burned.  No tongue was required to tell
us the terrible story of legal wrong, and worse than
feudal tyranny inflicted on the unresisting poor.  The
blackened rafters were lying on every hand among
the long grass, and thrown far asunder; the humble
walls were half levelled and overgrown by weeds,
like the hearths around which generations had sat,
and told or sung of the past memories of the Gael
and the kindly chiefs of other times, in the long
nights of winter, when Ben Ora was mantled by
snow, and the frozen cascade hung over the rocks,
white as the beard of Ossian.  Here a currant-bush,
or there an apple-tree, still marked amid the weeds
and heather where the garden of the peasant had
been.  Elsewhere the glen was yet dotted by little
patches of corn and potatoes, all growing wild; but
where were those who had sown and planted them?
</p>

<p>
Driven from their native land to make way for
sheep, or grouse, or deer, and packed in ships, like
slaves for the Cuban market, the old people of the
glen, the women and children, were pining on the
banks of the Susquehanna; while the young and able
were forced by starvation, or lured by false promises,
into the ranks of the Sutherland Highlanders, and were
now away to fight the Russians in the East.  Thus it
is that the game-laws, centralization, wilful neglect,
and maladministration, reduce the people of the glens
to misery, starvation, and inability to pay the
exorbitant rents demanded for their little farms; then
their dwellings are demolished, and themselves
expelled, that one vast game preserve may be made of
the land which has given to the British service
nearly ninety of its finest battalions of infantry.

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'My God!' exclaimed Callum, with deep emotion,
as he looked around him, with a fierce and saddened
eye, 'who now could think this place had given three
hundred swordsmen to Glenfinnon?'
</p>

<p>
'And sent two hundred with my father to Egypt?'
added I.
</p>

<p>
'Better had he and they stayed at home; for the
Mac Innons might yet have brooked the land their
fathers sprang from.'
</p>

<p>
Callum Dhu felt, as he spoke, like a true Celt&mdash;believing
that our ancestors sprang from the soil; <i>i.e.</i>
were the old and original race, without predecessors.
</p>

<p>
My father, the youngest of the two sons of Alaster
Mac Innon, of Glen Ora, was an officer of the 42nd
Highlanders, who served under Abercromby in Egypt
and Wellington in Spain.  His elder brother belonged,
unfortunately, to the Scots Fusilier Guards,
and amid the dissipation of a London life, 'in rivalling
the follies of his equals in birth and superiors
in fortune,' soon wasted his small but ancient patrimony,
which, though it could once bring 600 swordsmen
to the king's host, in more modern times did not
produce more than 600<i>l.</i> yearly rent.
</p>

<p>
Glen Ora was not entailed, thus its broad acres of
heather and whinstone-rock, mountain and torrent,
slipped from under the hands of my gay uncle like a
moving panorama; he died early, and the estate
passed away to strangers.  The old tower was
demolished, and a hunting-seat built on its site, by a
noble duke, whose family had enriched their pockets,
if not their blood, by intermarriage with the tribe of
Levi.  Then began the war of extermination and
expatriation in the north; and while the authoress
of "Uncle Tom" was feasted and slavery reviled in
the coteries of the Duchess in London, fire, sword,
and eviction were enforced by Mr. Snaggs, her factor,
in Glen Ora.  Thus had things continued until the
preceding year, when the estate was purchased by
Sir Horace Everingham, of Elton Hall, Yorkshire.
</p>

<p>
My father had died on service with his regiment
in Jamaica, when the yellow flag waved on Up-park
Camp, and the Highland bonnets lay as thick in the
yard of the pest-stricken barracks as ever they have
been on the battle-field; and my mother, a Stuart, of
Appin, brought me home to Glen Ora, where, with
the pension of a captain's widow, she endeavoured
to eke out a subsistence among our own people, and
occupied as a farm, at a small rental, the thatched
mansion, which in better times was the jointure-house
of our family.
</p>

<p>
But a ukase had gone forth!  The whole country
was doomed to become a deer-forest, desolate and
wild as when the first Fergus and his bare-kneed
Scots landed on its shores, which perhaps no foot
had trod since the waters of the Flood had left them.
</p>

<p>
The men of Glentuirc, a sept of our race, had already
been swept away, and now those of Glen Ora were to
follow.
</p>

<p>
As a necessary preliminary the rents had been
doubled and trebled, until we were incapable of
satisfying the rapacity of this alien lord, whose feudal
charters gave him a more than imperial power over
us.  A blight had fallen on our little corn-patches;
several of our sheep had been smothered in the snow,
and other troubles and difficulties fell thick and fast
upon us.  In vain Ephraim Snaggs, the factor, was
prayed for mercy; but to seek it from that astute
writer to the signet and grim elder of the kirk, was
'to take a bone from a tiger.'
</p>

<p>
The olden times were gone!  For ages unnumbered
the Highland landlord deemed that wealth
consisted in the number of families, and troops of
chubby children who lived upon his lands; farms
were divided and subdivided in the fertile glens,
until 'every rood of land maintained its man;' and
on every lot and rood was a tenant&mdash;a hardy soldier,
a tiller of the soil, and the father of a sturdy and a
faithful race.  The laird valued his property not by
the rent-roll, but by the number of brave and
leal-hearted swordsmen whose homes were made thereon.
This was the patriarchal system, old as the world
before the Flood; for feudality, with its barbarism,
its imaginary rights and slavish tenures, its monkish
parchments and legal villany, was unknown in the
Highlands until a comparatively recent period; and
then, noble was the struggle made against it by the
Wallace of the Celtic tribes, John of Moidart, who
expelled and slew his nephew Ronald Galda, for
accepting from James V. a feudal charter of the
lands which belonged to the tribe of which he,
Ronald, was the chief.  In this spirit, the Highland
peasant has a hereditary right to his hut&mdash;a right
derived from God&mdash;but kings have given our feudal
lords, even in the nineteenth century, a power over
the land on which the hut is built; and at their
behest whole villages are demolished, and the people
swept away with a heartless barbarity sufficient to
call down the lasting vengeance of heaven on the
ignoble dukes and canting marquises of the northern
and western Highlands!
</p>

<p>
But to resume:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
After traversing this Serbonian waste for a mile or
two, we reached a little cot built under the brow of a
rock; large blocks of whinstone, with a few courses
of turf above them, bedded in clay, formed the walls;
the roof, which was composed of divot, fern, and
straw, all firmly tied by ropes of heather, was covered
by moss of the richest emerald green.  It was a
humble dwelling, with a little window of one pane,
on each side of a rude door composed of three planks
nailed on bars; yet Callum Dhu, who had lived here
alone since his mother's death, never closed it at
meal-time, without coming forth to the road, in the
hospitable old Celtic spirit, to see if a stranger or
wayfarer were in sight.
</p>

<p>
Here we parted, as I resisted all his kind invitations
to enter, though the poor fellow had but little
to offer me; nor would I permit him to escort me
home, as he was weary after a long day of wandering.
Callum Mac Ian, the descendant of our hereditary
henchman, now supported himself by killing foxes,
weasels, and wild cats; for which, as these vermin
were very destructive, (especially the former among
the sheep,) he received a small sum from each cot-farmer
in Glen Ora.  This contribution, with a little
patch of potatoes, cultivated by himself, enabled him
to live; but as Callum occasionally took a shot at
other quadrupeds which were not considered vermin,
he was continually in scrapes and broils with the
keepers of the duke, the marquis, the laird, and other
adjoining potentates, whose ancestors, by force or
fraud, had partitioned the land of the Mac Innons, as
the powers of Europe did Poland.
</p>

<p>
'My love to dear Minnie,' said he, touching his
bonnet in the dark, as I left him; 'I would she were
here with me, for the cottage is dreary since my poor
mother went to the place of sleep on the hill; but
<i>achial</i>, Mac Innon! this is not a time in Glen Ora for
marrying or giving in marriage.'
</p>

<p>
Minnie was my mother's maid, and the object of
my foster-brother's boyish attachment.  They had
long loved each other, and had solemnly plighted their
troth by joining hands through the hole of the
Clach-na-Greiné; but Snaggs was their evil genius; for
with the daily dread of eviction and proscription
hanging over him, how could Callum pay the illegally-levied
marriage-tax of forty shillings, or bring a wife
under the caber of his hut, or ask leave to add one foot
in breadth to his little patch of potatoes and kail?
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes after, I stood at my mother's
door.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
MR. EPHRAIM SNAGGS.
</h3>

<p>
Our residence, the old jointure-house, now shorn of
its fair proportions, and diminished in aspect, since it
was built for the widow of Lachlan Mohr Mac Innon,
who led his clan to Worcester, was small, low in the
roof, and heavily thatched with warm heather.  The
two principal rooms were wainscoted; the entrance
was floored with hard-beaten clay, and above the door
was a rudely-carved representation of the arms of
Mac Innon, a boar's head erased, holding in its mouth
the legbone of a deer, supported by a lion and, a
leopard.  This uncouth piece of heraldry, the pride
of my mother's heart, was the <i>chef d'oeuvre</i> of some
local sculptor.  The aspect of the house was cheerless
and indicative of the decay that had fallen upon us;
the carpets were faded and worn; the furniture
antique and rickety; there were corner cupboards,
where old china, worm-eaten books, bottles of whisky,
powder-flasks, bullet-moulds, deer-horns, fishing-gear,
teapots, and coffee-cups, dogs' collars, an old
dirk and skene, mingled pell-mell with innumerable
other etcetera.
</p>

<p>
Far off on the mountain slope, the strong square
tower of Lachlan Mohr (who was besieged therein by
the Campbells after Inverlochy) was a landmark for
two hundred years; but now it was removed to make
way for a modern mansion, the windows of which, on
this evening, were brilliantly lighted up; and then,
I doubted not, Sir Horace Everingham was sitting
down to a sumptuous entertainment after his visit to
Ben Ora, while I, the heir of all these hills and glens,
had scarcely a crust to place before me.
</p>

<p>
I thought of all these things&mdash;the present and the
past&mdash;with a bitterness renewed by the recent
conversation with my foster-brother.  I tossed aside my
fishing-gear, basket, and bonnet, and with a sigh of
weariness and dejection, entered the half-dilapidated
mansion.  As I had been abroad the whole day, I
sought, with some anxiety, the apartment of my sick
and aged mother.  I heard the sound of voices
proceeding from it; she was expostulating, and a stranger
was threatening!  I made a forward stride, when a
hand was timidly laid on my arm; I turned, and met
the anxious face of pretty Minnie Mac Omish.
</p>

<p>
'A chial! a chial!' she whispered, with tears in
her soft hazel eyes; 'Snaggs, the factor, is with your
mother, Allan, and I fear he brings bad news.'
</p>

<p>
'Can other come to us now, Minnie?' said I; 'but
take my fish-basket&mdash;I have brought a good stipper
from the Uisc Dhu and Loch Ora.'
</p>

<p>
I then entered the little dining-room where we
usually had all our meals served up.
</p>

<p>
I see it yet in memory.
</p>

<p>
Like many apartments in old Highland houses, its
ceiling was low, pannelled with fir, and painted in a
dull white colour; the stone fireplace, heavily
moulded, bore the motto of the Mac Innons, <i>Cuimhuich
bas Alpin</i>, in raised letters, and the grate, a little
brass-knobbed basket, at which, as my nurse affirmed,
Prince Charles had once warmed his royal feet, stood
upon two blocks of stone.  A few old prints of battles
in black frames, an oil-portrait or two, an old ebony
table, with a huge family-bible, an inverted
punch-bowl cracked and riveted, chairs of a fashion that
has long since disappeared from the Lowlands, made
up the plenishing of this little chamber, which was
alike my mother's dining-room and peculiar sanctum
sanctorum&mdash;and the palladium of which, were the old
gilt gorget and regimental claymore of my father,
suspended above the chimney-piece.  He had worn
these during the campaigns with the Black Watch in
Egypt and in Spain.
</p>

<p>
With gold spectacles on nose, my mother, a thin,
pale woman of a dignified aspect, in an old-fashioned
costume, with black silk <i>mittens</i> on her hands, was
seated in her cushioned chair, affecting to work at
some ornament or article of attire, which lay on a
little tripod table.  She seemed nervous and agitated;
how could she be otherwise, when opposite sat he,
who was the horror of the glens from Lochness to
Loch Ora&mdash;Ephraim Snaggs, with his malevolent
visage, perched on the top of a bamboo-cane, over the
silver knob of which his hands were crossed.
</p>

<p>
Bald-headed, hollow in the temples, with a prominent
chin, and more of the serpent than the dove
in his sinister grey eye, there sat Mr. Snaggs with his
truculent smile, and an affectation of sympathy on
his tongue.
</p>

<p>
'Beware, sir, of what you say,' my mother was
exclaiming, 'for ours is an honoured line&mdash;an ancient
house.'
</p>

<p>
'So I perceive,' said Snaggs, impertinently, as he
fixed his eyes on a very palpable hole in the ceiling;
'ah, the old story&mdash;the old story, Mrs. Mac Innon!
Bad times and no price for sheep, eh?  I would beg
to remind you, my dear madam, that a certain pious
writer says, "However unfortunate we may deem
ourselves, yet let us remember there is an eye watching
over us; it is a heavenly will, not a blind fate,
that guides the world;" ah me&mdash;ah me!'
</p>

<p>
Fire and pride were flashing in my mother's dark
grey eyes as I entered; then she burst into tears, and
throwing down her work, exclaimed to me in Gaelic,
and with all the spirit of the olden time&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'My son, God has sent you here in a lucky hour!
I have come of a race that have smiled often in the
face of death&mdash;why then, do I weep before this
wretched worm?'
</p>

<p>
'What have you dared to say, Mr. Snaggs?' I
asked, turning sharply to that personage; 'why do
I find my mother in tears?'
</p>

<p>
'Because she is out of cash,' was the cool reply; 'a
simple reason, my dear sir, and a plain one; but it
is very little that <i>you</i> do to furnish her with any.  I
have called for the last time anent the arrears of rent
due to Sir Horace Everingham&mdash;the new proprietor
of this estate&mdash;arrears due before he acquired the
lands, and I receive still the same unvaried excuses,
about sheep with the rot, cattle with the murrain, or
scraps of traditions and antediluvian nonsense, about
the time when Loch Ora belonged to the Mac Innons&mdash;and
about your great-grandfather who fought at
Culloden, and was nearly hanged at Carlisle, as, I
think, he deserved to be, for opposing the House of
Hanover, and the Kirk as established by law.  Now
the law, of which I am an unworthy representative&mdash;<i>the
law says</i>, young man, that when a tenant&mdash;but I
need not quote the cases before the Lords of Council
and Session in 1792 or 1756 on this point, to <i>you</i>.  If
an instalment at least, of the aforesaid arrears&mdash;say
about fifty pounds&mdash;is not paid to me&mdash;to <i>me</i>, sir,' he
continued, laying a fat finger impressively into the
palm of his left hand, 'then a notice of eviction shall
be duly served upon you, with the rest of the lazy
wretches in Glen Ora, who must all sail for Canada
this summer, sure as my name is Ephraim Snaggs.
Moreover, sir, I may inform you, that Sir Horace, by
my recommendation&mdash;mine, sir&mdash;has some intentions
of pulling down this absurd-looking old house, and
erecting here a box for his friend, Captain Clavering,
or for Mr. Snobleigh, of Snobleigh Park, I know not
which; and if so, the law must be put in force against
you, sir&mdash;the law of expulsion&mdash;you hear me!'
</p>

<p>
The reader may imagine the pride, wrath, and
bitterness that swelled up within me, at this insolent
speech, which had gradually approached the bullying
point.  I made a stride towards Snaggs, and my
fingers twitched with an irresistible desire to grasp
his throat.
</p>

<p>
My mother (poor old woman!) had long been in ill
health.  Mhari Mac Innon the 'wise woman' of our
locality, and other aged people of the glen, alleged
her illness was caused by her declining to drink of
St. Colme's well, a famous medicinal spring in Glen
Ora, where, for ages, the Mac Innons and adjacent
tribes had been wont to quaff the water at midnight,
as a sovereign remedy for all diseases; and thereafter
drop in a coin, or tie a rag to the alders which
overshadowed it, as an offering to the guardian spirit of
the fountain.  Pale, sad, and sickly, my mother sat in
her high-backed chair, motionless and silent as if
overwhelmed by the approaching tide of ruin, in the
form of debt which we had not a shilling to meet&mdash;and
of avarice which we could not satisfy.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Snaggs,' said I, 'you should have reserved
your detestable communications for my ears alone,
and thus spared my poor mother the humiliation of a
moment so bitter as this.  She is old, and her thoughts
and ideas have come down to her from other times.
She cannot see, nor believe, that any man has authority
to turn her off the land of the Mac Innons&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Pooh, my dear sir,' said Snaggs, waving his hand,
and rising; 'if you are about to begin your old-world
nonsense and twaddle about Celtic right in the soil,
I must leave you.  The sheriff's warrants will tell
another story next week, if fifty pounds at least&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Listen to me, Ephraim Snaggs,' said I, forcing
him into a seat, and grasping his shoulder like a vice.
'I am here on the land that belonged to my forefathers&mdash;to
Angus Mac Innon, who fought for King James
at Culloden&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Ha-ha&mdash;stuff&mdash;there you go again!'
</p>

<p>
'There was a time,' I continued, fiercely, 'when
had you, or such as you, spoken above your breath in
Glen Ora, you had been flung into the loch with a
hundred weight of stone at your neck.  There was a
time when the Mac Innons owned all the land we
may see from Ben Ora; when we had Griban in
Mull, the Isles of Tiree, of Pabay, and Scalpa, with
Strathardle in Skye.  Poor as we are now, we owned
all that, but only in common&mdash;mark me, sir, <i>in
common</i>, with the people of our name.  Listen to me,
Mr. Snaggs,' I continued, as the fierce sob of pride, so
difficult to repress, rose to my throat; 'I am the last
of a long line, whose misfortune it has been to fight
for the losing side.  Our people marched to Worcester
under Lachlan M'hor, and perished there in heaps;
we were at Sheriffmuir, under the banner of the
Marquis of Seaforth, for a marquis he was, by order of
the king; we were "out" in the '45, under Angus
Mac Innon, and of all the swordsmen he marched
from yonder glen, which you are about to depopulate,
not a man came back from Culloden&mdash;as God hears
me&mdash;not one.  Since then our people have gone forth
in the Highland regiments to every part of the world.
Some have left their bones on the heights of Abraham
and in the isles of the Western Indies; some sleep
under the shadow of the Pyramids and on the plains
of the Peninsula.  In India, Egypt, Africa, and
Spain, wherever Britain wanted men to fight her
battles, there have they been faithful and true, loyal
and brave, standing foremost in the ranks of war,
and giving place to none!  All my own family have
perished in the service of their country since this
century began&mdash;I am the last of them, and as their
reward, our roof is to be torn from us, and we are to
be expelled from the home and the graves of our
kindred&mdash;we, the descendants of the old aboriginal
race, who first trod the land after God separated it
from the waters, and why? because a miserable fifty
pounds may not be forthcoming by a certain day!
There was a time, Mr. Ephraim Snaggs, when the
cry of <i>Bas Alpin</i> from yonder rock would easily have
brought six hundred swordsmen to guard the roof
you threaten; and he whom you beard&mdash;he, who
from the first Mac Innon, has come through twenty
generations in the right line.'
</p>

<p>
'Had you come through twenty generations in the
<i>wrong</i> line I would have respected you quite as much,
sir,' said Mr. Snaggs, with his bland professional
sneer, as he rose again, and smoothed the nap of his
hat, preparatory to retiring, as if wearied by the
torrent of Gaelic I had poured upon him.  'All these
fine arguments about broadswords and barbarism
won't pay the rent or satisfy the just claims of Sir
Horace, thus the law of landlord and tenant must
take its course.  You have no means of raising
money, I suppose?'
</p>

<p>
'None!'
</p>

<p>
'No friends&mdash;eh?'
</p>

<p>
'None.'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing you can sell?'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing!'
</p>

<p>
'Then, take my advice, and quietly quit the glen
altogether; there are plenty of counting-rooms,
offices, and shops in the Lowlands, where such great
sturdy fellows as you may easily make yearly, triple
the rent of this old tumble-down place, with its
patch of potatoes and corn.  Quit your gun and
fishing-rod&mdash;betake yourself to some honest and
industrious occupation, instead of indulging in the very
sophistry of vanity, and in wandering about these
hills the livelong day, sighing over an imaginary
past and an impossible future.  No man has any
right in the soil but such as the law gives him.  Why,
Mr. Allan, before I was half your age, I was one of
the smartest writer's clerks in Glasgow, earning my
threepence a page of a hundred and twenty-five
words; but perhaps you would prefer a shopman's
place&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
The shout with which Rob Roy greeted honest
Bailie Jarvie's proposal to take his two sons as
apprentices, was nothing to the shrill cry of anger with
which my mother interrupted the sneer I was too
poor to resent with pride&mdash;besides in its soundness,
the advice of Snaggs humbled, while it exasperated
me.
</p>

<p>
'I would rather see my boy Allan buried in his
grave at the Stones of St. Colme than truckling to a
Lowland dog like you, Ephraim Snaggs!  Begone,
lest I smite you on the face, weak though my hand,
for recommending a calling so vile to Mac Innon of
Glen Ora!'
</p>

<p>
'Mother, mother!' I exclaimed, 'what can I do?'
</p>

<p>
'Shoulder a musket and march to fight the Russians,
if God opens up no brighter or better path to
the son of a line that led their hundreds to battle
in the times of old!' was the fierce and Spartan
response.
</p>

<p>
'Very well, ma'am&mdash;very well,' continued the
matter-of-fact Snaggs, smoothing the nap of his beaver,
and smiling with his ticket-of-leave look.  '"The
gentle mind," saith the divine Blair, "is like the
smooth stream, which reflects every object in its just
proportion and in its fairest colours;" but these
outbursts of anger, in the style of Helen Mac Gregor or
Lady Macbeth, won't satisfy Sir Horace Everingham;
and if the sum of fifty pounds, at least, be not
forthcoming&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
A tremendous knocking at the outer door, and the
sound of voices in great agitation, arrested the factor's
angry farewell.  Minnie grew pale, and hurried to
open, and hastening into the passage, I met two of
the Englishmen and the ladies, with disorder
apparent in their attire and alarm in their faces.  The
oldest of their party, Sir Horace, was absent; and
now the danger of the mountain, and the warnings
withheld by Callum Dhu, rushed reproachfully on
my memory.
</p>

<p>
'My father, Mr. Mac Innon&mdash;my father, Mr. Snaggs!'
exclaimed Miss Everingham, rushing towards
us, with clasped hands.  'I seek succour for
my father!' she continued, trembling, agitated, pale,
and in tears, and with hair and dress disordered.
</p>

<p>
'How&mdash;your father&mdash;Sir Horace?'
</p>

<p>
'We missed him at the rock, Mr. Snaggs, on Ben
Ora&mdash;the steep rock, I know not how you name it!'
</p>

<p>
'The Craig-na-tuirc,' said I.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;thank you&mdash;yes; and he did not come back
to us.'
</p>

<p>
'Some dreadful event must have occurred,' added
her dark-eyed companion, Miss Clavering, whose
usual bloom was blanched and gone; 'so many
accidents&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Get us some aid, my good man,' said her brother,
a tall and soldier-like fellow, with a heavy black
moustache and a dragoon air; 'ropes, poles, and a
couple of stable-lanterns, if you have such things.
We must make a search after the old gentleman&mdash;come
Snobleigh, my boy, look sharp!'
</p>

<p>
'Oh-aw-yaas,' drawled his companion, who had a
very used-up air, and wore a short-tailed tartan
shooting-jacket, an eye-glass, a cigar in his mouth,
and a faint moustache under his snub nose; 'young
fellow, eh-aw-aw, what is your name?'
</p>

<p>
'Glen Ora,' said my mother, interrupting me, and
half springing from her chair, irate at his
nonchalance.
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;odd&mdash;very, Mr. Glen Ora; you'll look aftaw
the ladies, whom we shall leave here in your chawge.'
</p>

<p>
'I am master here, at least,' said I, haughtily;
'Snaggs, hand chairs&mdash;see to the ladies, while I go
to the Craig-na-tuirc, to search for Sir Horace.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh thank you&mdash;bless you!' exclaimed Miss Everingham,
grasping my arm; 'all my trust is in you,
Allan.'
</p>

<p>
'Lanterns&mdash;eh, aw-aw, you'll require&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'The moon is up, and we require no other light,'
said I, cutting short this mouthing drawler; 'come,
Callum Mac Ian,' I added, as that personage, whose
solitary hut the alarm had reached, appeared among
us; 'old Sir Horace has fallen over the Craig-na-tuirc,
or lost his way on the hills&mdash;let us seek him.'
</p>

<p>
Though weak and tottering, my mother had
propped herself upon her cane, and risen to her full
height, which was tall and commanding, to welcome
those agitated and unceremonious visitors.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Snaggs,' said she, pointing to the door, with
the air of a Siddons, 'you may retire.'
</p>

<p>
Snaggs bowed with a malevolent smile, and withdrew.
</p>

<p>
'Ladies, be seated&mdash;gentlemen, assist the ladies to
seats&mdash;thank you; be composed, Miss Everingham,
and be assured that we will leave nothing undone to
discover your father, who must have lost his way on
the mountains.  They were not made for Lowland
legs to climb,' she added, with a cold smile.
</p>

<p>
Her stature, her lofty air, and calm decisive
manner, awed the two English girls, and calmed their
excessive agitation, while it dashed the somewhat
brusque air of the gentlemen; and, reseating herself
in her wide, old-fashioned chair, she spread her skirt
all over it, in a way peculiar to ladies of 'the old
school,' and then fixed her keen grey Highland eyes
upon her unexpected and not over-welcome visitors,
to learn the cause of all this commotion and alarm
for one towards whom it may easily be supposed she
felt but little love, as she deemed poor Sir Horace
little better than a usurper, and was wont to stigmatize
him roughly in Gaelic as 'a Hanoverian rat.'
</p>

<p>
I snatched a hunting-horn, Callum threw off his
plaid, and leaving the two perfumed gentlemen to
follow us as they best could in their well-glazed boots
and tightly-strapped pantaloons, we took our way
with all speed towards the rocky summit of Ben Ora.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
<br /><br />
THE BOOK OF THE BOAR.
</h3>

<p>
The sudden presence of Laura Everingham under
my mother's roof had, for a moment, confused and
astonished me, filling me with tremulous anxiety for
the issue of their interview.
</p>

<p>
Laura was a lady-like girl, pretty rather than beautiful,
and graceful rather than dignified, with a bright
sunny English eye, a pale but interesting face,
matchless hands and ankles, and a profusion of chestnut
hair.  She had trembled excessively when I presented
her to my mother, whom she informed, as rapidly
and coherently as her excessive agitation would
permit, that Sir Horace, 'her dear, good, kind papa,
would go to the summit of the mountain in the moonlight,
in spite of all advice and the warnings of various
shepherds.'
</p>

<p>
'The old gentlemen is, aw&mdash;aw, rather nocturnal
in his tastes, madam,' yawned Mr. Snobleigh, who
had been surveying the dining-room through his
glass, with great apparent curiosity and much
unmistakable depreciation; 'town habits, madam, won't
suit this parallel&mdash;aw, of north latitude.'
</p>

<p>
'And he would visit the Craig-na-tuirc,' continued
Laura; 'for dear papa is such an obstinate old thing,
and we are always so afraid of the gout flying to his
head, that we never dare to cross him.  Well, we
ascended that horrid mountain, and after great danger
and labour reached the shoulder or cliff, Craig-na-tuirc,
I think, you name it, just in time to see the
moon rise above the hills, and a lovely moon it
was&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;for Scotland&mdash;very!' said Mr. Snobleigh.
</p>

<p>
'We were at the very verge of the precipice, with
our little ponies, from which we had all dismounted,
but dear old obstinate papa, who would keep his
saddle, when suddenly an eagle soared up, with its
huge flapping wings, from amid our feet&mdash;our wild
ponies took to flight&mdash;scampered down the mountain,
and vanished; that which bore papa accompanied
them; we heard him crying piteously for help&mdash;oh,
heaven, how piteously!  And then, a white stag shot
past&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'God and Mary!&mdash;a white stag?' exclaimed my mother.
</p>

<p>
'Then all became still, so frightfully still, that I
heard only my own heart beating.  Oh, dear madam,'
added Laura Everingham, clasping my mother's hand,
emotion lending new charms to her winning face and
manner, 'do you think there is danger?'
</p>

<p>
'Heaven alone knows; if indeed the sheltie galloped
towards the Uisc Dhu&mdash;' my mother paused, for even
her strong antagonism to this fair daughter of a man
she hated, and against whom all her fierce and
antiquated Celtic prejudices were enlisted, could not
withstand the charm of Laura's winning eye; thus
she left nothing unsaid to comfort her and to soothe
her terror.  In this she was joined by Miss Clavering,
a fine, handsome, and showy English girl, whose
beautiful and sparkling eyes, dark hair, and nose
<i>retroussé</i>, piquant manner, and graceful <i>tournure</i>,
made her, as her brother Tom Clavering, of the
Grenadier Guards, constantly affirmed, 'one of the
finest girls about town,' meaning London, of course.
</p>

<p>
'And you saw a white stag?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;white as snow,' answered the girls, together.
</p>

<p>
'Dhia!' exclaimed my mother; 'if it should be the
white stag of Loch Ora!'
</p>

<p>
'Why&mdash;what then?'
</p>

<p>
'It is said to be enchanted&mdash;it never dies, and never
appears but as a harbinger of evil!'
</p>

<p>
'Heavens, dear madam, don't say so, pray!' urged
Laura, weeping bitterly, and here Callum Dhu and I
left them.
</p>

<p>
Followed by Captain Tom Clavering and his friend,
Mr. Adolphus Frederick Snobleigh, who, with their
glazed boots, scarlet shirts, and blue neckties, tight
pantaloons, pomaded locks, and bandolined moustaches,
were scarcely accoutred for ascending the
sides of Ben Ora at midnight, over heather
ankle-deep, and drenched in dew, or over&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Crags, knolls and mounds, confusedly hurled,<br />
  The fragments of an earlier world.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Callum Dhu and I hastened round the base of the
mountain, and sought the Craig-na-tuirc for traces of
the missing stranger.  The moon was clear and
bright, though obscured at times by fleecy cloudlets,
and we soon reached the summit of the steep craig,
or <i>Rock of the Boar</i>, and saw the wild glens and savage
peaks of the western Highlands bounding the view
on every side, while at our feet lay Loch nan Spiordan,
or the Lake of Spirits, which was haunted by the
water-horse and bull, and from which the Uisc Dhu,
or <i>black stream</i>, brawled through a hundred rough
ravines and stony chasms, into the deep dark basin of
Loch Ora.  Here we paused for a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
The voice and image of Laura Everingham were still
before me; for one more fair or polished had never
been beneath the roof-tree of our mountain dwelling,
and on regaining my breath, I said, with some
emotion, to Callum,
</p>

<p>
'If he has fallen into the Black Water!'&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;he may turn up about Christmas-time&mdash;a
bag of bones, stranded on the margin of the loch,'
was the grim response.
</p>

<p>
'And we allowed him to ascend&mdash;what will people
say?'
</p>

<p>
'There will be none here to say anything,' was the
sharp response; 'by that time Glen Ora will be
desolate&mdash;its people gone to the shores of the Far
West, and the warm hearths where they sit now, will
be silent, cold, and grassy.'
</p>

<p>
'But the Englishman's daughter, Callum?'
</p>

<p>
'Let her weep to the night wind, and it will hear
her, as it has often heard our women weep, when the
roofs were torn down and the fires extinguished;
when the cabers were tossed upon the heath, and the
cottagers were driven in fetters to the shore, like
slaves for market.'
</p>

<p>
'But his daughter is beautiful.'
</p>

<p>
'Dioul! do <i>you</i> begin to think so?'
</p>

<p>
'Fair, delicate, and gentle, too, Callum,' I urged,
warming a little.
</p>

<p>
'But what of that? she is a stranger, and not one
of us!  It was not at such dainty breasts as hers that
Lachlan Mohr, who could twist a horse-shoe, or
Angus your ancestor, or Alisdair Mac Coll Keitach,
who could cleave men from beard to breeks, were
suckled.'
</p>

<p>
'What the deuce does all this matter?  I would
rather have a silver pound in my pocket than a
pedigree an ell long; but wind your horn, and then let
us shout.'
</p>

<p>
Callum blew his horn, but the echoes of the rocks
alone replied in prolonged reverberations to the
sound.  Then we shouted together, and again the
echoes were our sole reply.  The more I thought of
the fair and timid girl now at my mother's house, the
more anxious I felt for her father's fate.
</p>

<p>
Myriads of stars were mirrored in the lone and deep
blue Loch of the Spirits, a thousand feet below us,
and as we traversed the beetling cliff, the stones we
disengaged, rolled over and plashed into the water, with a
dull faint sound that was long in ascending to the ear.
</p>

<p>
'By the Black Stone of Scone,' said Callum, with a
Highland grin, 'if the stranger <i>has</i> gone over here on
the sheltie, he will have a skinful of cold water by
this time.'
</p>

<p>
'For heaven's sake, don't say so, Callum!'
</p>

<p>
'Why not?' returned my companion, tartly; 'his
first threat, on coming among us, was to put me in
prison, because a deer-hide was found in my hut; if
he has gone over the Craig-na-tuirc it was his own
fate, and you know our proverb&mdash;Ni droch dhuine
dan na fein!  <i>Me</i> in prison, indeed!  I swore that I
found the deer drowned in the moss, though I shot
him at the waterfall, and a brave animal he
was&mdash;thirty-four stone weight&mdash;devil an ounce less, after
the gralloch was out of him; so every man in the
glen had a savoury supper that night.  Must <i>we</i> starve,
while the Englishman and the Lowlander have sport
enough and to spare, and when the poor are driven
mad by the depredations of the game on the crops?'
</p>

<p>
'Hark!  I hear voices!'
</p>

<p>
Turning in the direction from whence they proceeded,
we met Captain Clavering and his companion,
the exquisite Mr. Snobleigh, who had just succeeded
in overtaking us, breathless, and in great anxiety for
Sir Horace.
</p>

<p>
'It was in <i>that</i> direction Sir Horace was carried by
his pony,' said the captain, pointing westward down
the rocks.
</p>

<p>
'Dioul!  that is straight for the linn of Glen-dhu-uisc
(the glen of the black water), and if so, God
save him!' added Callum, touching his bonnet, 'for
his bones&mdash;before <i>we</i> find them&mdash;will have been picked
white as china by the gled and iolar.  However, let
us do what we can, Mac Innon,' he added, hastening
onward, his natural kindness of heart penetrating
the crust of prejudice and animosity with which he
had resolved to protect it from any emotion of
sympathy for the new possessor of our lands.
</p>

<p>
'The mountain sheltie went like lightning,' said
Captain Clavering; 'its hoofs struck fire from the
rocks at every bound.'
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;yes,' added his companion, the great head
of the dynasty of Snobleigh; 'I daresay the poor
baronet thought himself astride one of Scott's demmed
water kelpies.'
</p>

<p>
The roar of the cataract, formed by the Uisc Dhu
forcing its way through a chasm, and rolling over a
ledge of rocks into Loch Ora, now broke the solemn
stillness of the midnight hills.  We reached a plateau
of rock, which overhung the fall, and we felt it
trembling and vibrating in the concussion of the
waters, which roared and rushed in one broad,
ceaseless, and snow-white torrent, into a deep dark pool
below.  Its height was startling; its sides bristled
with ghastly rocks, and these were fringed by tangled
masses of green shrubbery and wild plants.
Glittering in the moonlight like dew, or a continual
shower of revolving diamonds, the transparent foam
arose from the profundity into which the descending
waters bellowed, and beyond which they swept away
round the mountain in placid silence, forming Loch
Ora, where the black ouzel and the wild swan floated
in the radiance of the summer moon.
</p>

<p>
Captain Clavering appeared to be impressed by this
majestic scene, but his companion, a restless Londoner,
prattled and talked, and ever and anon shouted
'Sir Horace!' in the voice of a peacock proclaiming
rain.
</p>

<p>
'Stay; I hear something,' said I; 'it comes from
yonder rock.'
</p>

<p>
'No, no,' replied Callum, hastily; 'do not say
so&mdash;that is Sien Sluai (the dwelling of a multitude).
Often when my father was benighted, he has seen
lights glitter there, and heard the sound of music,
dancing feet, and merry little voices.'
</p>

<p>
A moment after, we heard a lamentable cry, that
was quite different from the echoes.
</p>

<p>
'Good heaven!' exclaimed Captain Clavering,
'there is some one over the fall&mdash;or <i>in it</i>.  Did you
not hear a voice?  There it is again!'
</p>

<p>
'Dioul!  I have heard it twice already, but thought
it was a hart roaring in the forest,' said Callum;
'and here are the hoofmarks of a pony, fresh in the
turf, at the very edge of the Fall.'
</p>

<p>
'Help!' cried a piteous voice, which ascended from
the abyss beneath us, and sounded above the hiss and
roar of the hurrying waters; 'help, in the name of
the blessed God!'
</p>

<p>
'Merciful heaven, it is Sir Horace!' exclaimed
Captain Clavering, peering over.
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;aw, good gwacious&mdash;gwacious goodness! aw-aw,
what a dreadful situation!' added Snobleigh,
aghast.
</p>

<p>
Upon a ledge of rock that jutted over the fall
about twenty feet below the plateau on which we
stood, lay the unfortunate baronet, crouching in a
place where the beetling rocks rose above him, and
where they descended sheer below to a depth which
the eye and mind shrank from contemplating.  His
pony had become unmanageable, or disliked the
severity with which it was whipped and spurred;
thus on getting the bit between its teeth, it scoured
along the terrible ridge of the Craig-na-tuirc like the
wind, and rushed headlong towards the cascade.  In
deadly terror, the portly baronet had thrown himself
off this fierce and shaggy little charger, but too late;
he was just at the edge of the fall over which the
pony went headlong like a flying Pegasus.  Desperately
Sir Horace clung to the bracken and heather
on the verge of the chasm; but both gave way, and
he toppled over!&mdash;sight, sound, hearing, and sensation
left him as he fell into the abyss, believing all was
over; but the sharp, cool, smoky spray revived him,
and on recovering, he found himself safely and softly
shelved on a turf-covered ledge of rock, from which
an ascent unaided was totally impracticable, as the
cliff above him was a sheer wall of twenty feet high;
and a safe descent was equally impossible, for below,
two hundred feet and more, pouring like ceaseless
thunder, the cascade roared, boomed, boiled, and
whirled; he shut his eyes, and for the first time
since childhood, perhaps, endeavoured to arrange his
thoughts in prayer.
</p>

<p>
Imagine the sensations of this right honourable
baronet, and M.P. for 'the gentlemanly interest'&mdash;this
old Regent-street lounger and man-about-town,
accustomed to all the butterfly enjoyment, the ease,
elegance, and luxury wealth can procure, and London
furnish, on finding himself at midnight in the region
of old romance and much imaginary barbarism&mdash;-in
the land of caterans, brownies, and bogles, cowering
like a water-rat on a narrow ledge of rock, and on the
verge of that tremendous cascade!
</p>

<p>
Prayer was difficult, new, and unnatural to him;
he closed his eyes, and after shouting hopelessly and
vainly, he endeavoured not to think at all; terror
absorbed all his faculties, and now were he to live for a
thousand years he could never forget the miseries
and horrors he endured.
</p>

<p>
His senses wandered, and while the endless linn,
stunning and dashing, poured in full flood and mighty
volume over the trembling rocks, at one time he
imagined himself addressing the House on the Abjuration
Oath, the Scottish Appellate Jurisdiction, or some
other equally sane and useful institution; or at the
opera listening to Mario, Alboni, or Piccolomini; now
it was the voice of his daughter, and then the laugh
of his ward, Fanny Clavering.  The quaint wild
stories of the Highland foresters flitted before him,
and while strange voices seemed to mingle with the
ceaseless roar of that eternal cataract; damp kelpies
sprawled their long and clammy fingers over him;
paunchy imps and bearded brownies swarmed about
his ears like gnats in the moonshine; while grey
spectres seemed to peer and jabber at him, from amid
the pouring foam and impending rocks.
</p>

<p>
He grew sick and faint with fear and hopelessness,
for he was a cold, proud, and narrow-hearted man;
hence the agony of his mind was the greater when he
found himself face to face, and front to front, with
Death!
</p>

<p>
Hours passed away; they seemed months, years,
ages, still he remained there in a state of torpor and
coma.  He might fall into the stream; then all would
be over; he might linger on for days, his cries
unheard, for the country was desolate and depopulated&mdash;for
days until he perished of slow starvation, and
his bones would be left to whiten on that shelf of rock
after his flesh had been carried away by the hawks
and eagles!
</p>

<p>
'Horror! horror!' he exclaimed, and shut his
eyes.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, voices that seemed human met his ear!
</p>

<p>
He uttered a wild cry for mercy and for succour
and the loud Highland <i>haloo</i> of Callum Mac Ian
responded.  By a lucky chance we had discovered the
lost man, when every hope was dying in his arid heart.
</p>

<p>
A mountain-ash, the sinewy roots of which grasped
the fissures of the rocks, and were knotted round
them, overhung the chasm, and from this Callum,
supported by Clavering and me&mdash;the captain was a
brave, active, and athletic fellow&mdash;lowered down a
stout rope, which we desired Sir Horace to tie
securely round him; but he was so paralyzed by fear,
or so benumbed by cold, that though we reiterated
the request again and again, with all the energy his
urgent danger could inspire, we were unheeded.
</p>

<p>
'Dioul! 'smeas so na'n t-alam!' (the devil! this is
worse than alum!) grumbled Callum in Gaelic; this
old fellow will have the cat's departure in the cascade
if he closes his ears thus!'
</p>

<p>
'What in heaven's name shall we do?' asked Captain
Clavering; 'good fellows, can't you advise?'
</p>

<p>
'Go down into the cascade,' said I.
</p>

<p>
'Eh&mdash;aw&mdash;the deuce! good gwacious, you cawnt
mean that,' said Snobleigh, with a chill shudder;
'deaw me&mdash;what a boaw!'
</p>

<p>
'He does mean it,' replied Callum, coldly; 'but
that shall be my task, for though his spirit is brave,
his arm is less strong than mine, and I shall meet the
danger first.  It was our task of old&mdash;I am his
co-dhalta, and come of race that were the leine chrios
of his father's on many a bloody field&mdash;but I forget
that you are Englishmen, and know not what I
speak of.'
</p>

<p>
Even while he said this, Callum had flung aside his
bonnet and plaid; tied one end of the rope round the
ash, and knotted the other round his waist, and begun
to descend into the chasm, finding grasps for his
hands and rests for his feet where other men would
have felt for them in vain; and scaring the polecat
from its lair, and the chattering night-hawk from its
perch, by his hearty shout of triumph, as he reached
Sir Horace, and transferred the rope round his inert
and passive form.
</p>

<p>
'Air Dhia! the old man is like a bundle of dry
bracken,' said the bold Highland forester with some
contempt; 'hoist away sirs, and be sure that you have
a tight hold of <i>your</i> end of the rope!'
</p>

<p>
Assisted by Mr. Snobleigh, who was in a high state
of excitement, the Captain and I drew up the poor
baronet, who was almost dead with renewed terror on
finding himself suspended like the golden fleece over
that roaring gulf; however, we landed him safely, and
laid him at length on the thick soft heather to recover
his breath and animation, while we lowered the rope
to Callum, who with our assistance scrambled up the
wall of rock like a squirrel, and stood beside us
again.
</p>

<p>
'Mona mon dioul!' said he, with a hearty laugh,
such as can only come from a throat and lungs braced
by the keen mountain air; 'this will be a night for
the new laird to remember!'
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
CALLUM DHU.
</h3>

<p>
Morning was beginning to brighten the sky behind
the sharp peaks of the eastern hills as we slowly
descended from the lofty summit of the Craig-na-tuirc.
We had got our English visitors up to that altitude
very well; but getting them <i>down</i> from it proved a
very different and more arduous affair: Callum at
last lost all patience, and saying that he wished he
'had a keallach to carry the dainty bodach in,' hoisted
Mr. Snobleigh, <i>bongré malgré</i>, on his shoulders, and
sturdily carried him to the foot of the mountain
leaving to Captain Clavering and me the task of
laughing, and supporting the crest-fallen baronet.
</p>

<p>
The sun had risen above the mountains when we
reached the narrow path that traversed my native and
old hereditary glen; the morning wind was lifting
the light leaves of the silver birches, and rustling the
wiry foliage of the Scottish pines that clothed the
steep sides of the lovely valley.  At times a roebuck
started up from among the green and waving
bracken, to vanish with a wild bound into the gloomy
thickets; and the pale mist was wreathing the dun
summit of Ben Ora.
</p>

<p>
A flood of amber glory rolled along the hills,
lighting up in quick succession each rocky peak and
heath-clad cone, and filling all the glens with warmth
as the sun arose; and Callum Dhu, whose mind was
full of the ancient usages and superstitions of the
Gael, raised his bonnet with reverence to the god of
day.
</p>

<p>
''Pon my soul, you are a rum one!' exclaimed
Mr. Snobleigh, as he was set on the ground again;
'but&mdash;aw&mdash;aw&mdash;fine fellow after all; we owe you I don't
know how much for your bravery, and I for this
canter down hill,' he added, unclasping his
porte-monnaie.
</p>

<p>
'I am neither a horse nor a servant,' said Callum,
with a dark expression in his eye.
</p>

<p>
Now that Sir Horace was free from danger, and
felt somewhat mollified towards mankind in the
Highlands generally, every bitter thought which the
teachings of my Celtic mother, the precepts of my
nurse, and the example of Callum could inspire,
returned with renewed vigour to my breast; and on
reaching the rugged bridle-road, with a haughty,
hostile, and distant aspect, I touched my bonnet, and on
seeing the baronet's carriage approaching (together
with Mr. Snaggs on a trotting mountain garron), was
about to withdraw, when Clavering politely requested
me to stay.
</p>

<p>
On the patrimonial estate of my forefathers, I found
myself regarded as little better than a shepherd, and
treated by these pampered strangers as a mere gilly,
trapper, or bush-beater; and my fiery spirit revolted
within me, on reflecting that the poor attire Callum
and myself wore, declared us to be little better.  But
find, if you may, a Birmingham baronet, or a cotton
lord, whose titles came with the Reform Bill, who
will acknowledge that a Scottish chief whose name
and lineage may be coeval with Old King Cole, or the
Wars of Fingal, can be equal to his own.
</p>

<p>
The carriage halted; a liveried lacquey sprang
from the rumble, banged down the steps, and opened
the door, on which Laura Everingham and Fanny
Clavering alighted to welcome and embrace Sir
Horace, who received this demonstration with the
proper and well-bred frigidity of one who abhorred
'a scene;' but his daughter hung upon his neck,
calling him her 'dear papa&mdash;her own papa,' while
observing with alarm that he trembled excessively,
his whole nervous system being seriously shaken, as
well it might.
</p>

<p>
'You are ill, dear papa!' said Laura, regarding
him anxiously.
</p>

<p>
'A draught from St. Colme's well might do him
good,' said Callum Dhu; 'but perhaps he has water
enough in him already&mdash;and so, a good sup of
whisky&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Right,' said Captain Clavering, searching in the
pocket of the carriage, and producing a flask of
brandy, a 'nip' from which greatly revived the old
gentleman, who, in a few words, made his daughter
and her friend acquainted with the danger he had
run, and the courage by which he had been rescued.
</p>

<p>
'So you see, Mr. Snaggs,' said the baronet, 'our
Celt here, with the beard like a French sapeur, has
been to me a real friend.'
</p>

<p>
'Glad to hear it, Sir Horace,' mumbled Snaggs
with one of his detestable smiles; 'but how seldom
do we find one&mdash;what is it the divine Blair saith,
Mr. Snobleigh?'
</p>

<p>
'Eh&mdash;aw&mdash;don't know, really.'
</p>

<p>
'It is <i>this</i>, my dear sir; "there is a friend that
loveth at all times and a brother that is born for
adversity.  Thine own friend, and thy father's friend,
forsake not."'
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;vewy good&mdash;devilish good, indeed!'
</p>

<p>
Miss Everingham, while her pale cheek glowed,
and then grew pale again, fixed her bright eyes, full
of tears, and gratitude upon Callum and me, and
while touching our hands, timidly, exclaimed,
</p>

<p>
'Oh, how shall we ever thank you&mdash;how repay
this!'
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;aw&mdash;'pon my soul, that is just what I have
been thinking of,' said Snobleigh, who 'mouthed'
his words as if he had been reared in the Scottish
law courts, where we may daily hear the most
astounding and miraculous English that tongue can
utter.
</p>

<p>
My heart throbbed; a new and undefinable emotion
thrilled through me, at the touch of Laura's soft
and pretty hands, and the truthful, thankful, and
earnest glance of her soft blue English eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, that devil of a pony!' sighed Sir Horace; 'I
hope its neck was broken at the cascade.  Egad! it
started off with me as if it had been running for the
Ascot Cup!'
</p>

<p>
'So did all our cattle.  How lucky that we were
dismounted!' observed Miss Clavering.
</p>

<p>
'It was like the Start for the Derby,' laughed her
brother.
</p>

<p>
'Or the Doncaster Cup and Saucer,' added
Snobleigh, 'Sir Horace leading the way.'
</p>

<p>
'But it is time we were moving,' said that
personage.  'Come&mdash;you, sir, to whom I owe so
much&mdash;what is your name?'
</p>

<p>
'Callum Dhu Mac Ian.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, well; get into the rumble, and come with us
to Glen Ora House, and you shall have lunch and a
good bottle of wine with the butler.'
</p>

<p>
'I do not lunch, neither do I dine with lacqueys,'
replied Callum, proudly.
</p>

<p>
'Whew! aw&mdash;I see&mdash;these Highland fellows are
all alike.  Clavering, have you any money about you?'
</p>

<p>
The captain handed his purse to the baronet, who
took from it, and from his own, the gold they
contained, and turning to Callum, said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'My good fellow, here are fifteen sovereigns; but
you will call on me at Glen Ora House, and bring
your friend with you; new coats and shoes, &amp;c., are
at your service; but what the devil is the matter
with you?'
</p>

<p>
'Monna, mon dioul! is it money you would offer
me?' asked Callum, as he drew himself up with the
air of an Indian king; 'so you value your life at
fifteen dirty guineas?'
</p>

<p>
'How, fellow; do you really wish more?'
</p>

<p>
'<i>More!</i>' reiterated Callum, fiercely; 'I am a poor
man, who, when I lie down at night, thank God that
one other day is passed, though I know not where
the food of to-morrow may come from.  The hills
teem with game, and the rivers are alive with fish;
yet I dare neither shoot one nor net the other.  But
keep your gold, Sir Horace.  Every coin of it is
accursed, for it has come to you through the filthy
hands of your factor, and every groat of it is stained
by the sweat&mdash;the tears&mdash;the blood of the Highlanders
of Glen Ora, from whom it has been extorted
and torn by Ephraim Snaggs, that merciless and
rapacious oppressor of the poor!'
</p>

<p>
Sir Horace stared at this outburst, which Callum
Mac Ian, notwithstanding his sharp Celtic accent, and
Gaelic being his native language, spoke in good
English, and with all the purity and fluency of an
educated Highlander.  The factor, who was close by
muttered something about 'an insolent idle poacher;'
but Captain Clavering patted Callum on the shoulder,
and exclaimed, in his jolly off-hand way,
</p>

<p>
'You are a trump! ha, ha, ha&mdash;'pon my soul, I
like this!'
</p>

<p>
'You are the most puzzling fellow imaginable!'
said Sir Horace, who had now recovered his self-possession,
and with it his usual bearing, which was
cold, pompous, selfish, and aristocratic (I am sorry to
add, ungrateful); he added, 'would your friend take
the money?'
</p>

<p>
The expression of my eye, I presume, startled him,
for he asked,
</p>

<p>
'Who are you, sir, may I ask?'
</p>

<p>
'Alan Mac Innon,' I replied briefly.
</p>

<p>
'The idle, roving son of a poor widow,' suggested
the amiable Mr. Snaggs, with a dark look.
</p>

<p>
'Widow of the last Glen Ora, Captain of Grenadiers
in the Black Watch,' said Callum, sharply;
'Co-dhalta,' he added to me, in Gaelic&mdash;'be not
offended&mdash;they are strangers, and know no better.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, well, I must leave to our sermon-quoting
friend, Mr. Snaggs, the task of rewarding you, for,
egad, I know not how to treat you,' said Sir Horace,
turning towards the carriage and handing in Miss
Clavering and his daughter Laura; 'but give them
a dram, Clavering&mdash;it will be acceptable all round, I
have no doubt.'
</p>

<p>
Callum Dhu produced from his jacket pocket a
silver-rimmed quaigh, which had belonged to the
ill-fated Mac Ian of the '45, and from which it was
averred <i>Prionse Tearlach</i> himself had drunk.  The
captain filled it with brandy for me, and I drank and
bowed to all.  It was refilled for my foster-brother,
who, while lifting his bonnet, bowed politely to the
strangers, and then turning to me, added,
</p>

<p>
'Mo Cheann Chinnidh-sa!  Beannachd Dhe' oirbh!'
(<i>i.e.</i>, My own chief&mdash;God bless you!')
</p>

<p>
My heart swelled; <i>his chief!</i> and I had no right to
the soil, beyond the dust that adhered to my shoes;
yet Callum's respect for me was as great as if I
possessed all the lands of the Siol nan Alpin.
</p>

<p>
'Egad, this is like some of the things I have read
of in the Scotch novels,' said Sir Horace, with a
supercilious smile; 'is it not, Laura?'
</p>

<p>
'Exactly, papa.'
</p>

<p>
'If I had only my sketch-book here,' added her
friend.
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;yaas&mdash;vewy good,' drawled Mr. Snobleigh,
as he applied a vesta to his meerschaum; 'here we
have a couple of bare-legged Sawney Beans, and all
we want is a witch with a caldron&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Fillet of a fenny snake,<br />
  In the caldron boil and bake:<br />
  Eye of newt and toe of frawg,<br />
  Wool of bat and tongue of dawg,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
and all that sort of thing&mdash;a brownie&mdash;aw-aw&mdash;a
black dwarf, and so forth; eh, Miss Everingham?'
</p>

<p>
'Anything you please, Mr. Snobleigh, now that
dear papa is safe.'
</p>

<p>
'Safe,' added the frank Tom Clavering; 'but for
our brave and sturdy friends, he had now perhaps
been at the bottom of yonder lock&mdash;or <i>loch</i>, as they
call it.'
</p>

<p>
'It is a bit of romance, Laura, love,' said Miss
Clavering, with one of her brightest smiles; 'do not
the place, the costume, and the whole affair, remind
you of&mdash;what is it&mdash;you remember the book,
Mr. Snobleigh?'
</p>

<p>
'Eh&mdash;aw, yaas,' was the languid reply; 'but do
you admire the costume, eh?  I was once nearly
dispensing with the superfluous luxury of pantaloons
myself, and, aw-aw, exchanging from the Grenadier
Gawds into an 'Ighland corps, which threw us into
the shade in the Phoenix Pawk.'
</p>

<p>
'The deuce you were,' said Clavering; 'that would
be to commence the sliding-scale, Snob, my boy;
from the Guards to the line, and from thence'&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Eh&mdash;aw&mdash;to the dawgs.'
</p>

<p>
'You are a noble fellow,' said Laura Everingham
to Callum; 'and I shall never, never forget you!'
</p>

<p>
Callum bowed.
</p>

<p>
'Give my dearest love to Mrs. Mac Innon&mdash;the
kind old lady your mother,' she added to me; 'and
say that I shall ever remember her kindness&mdash;poor
dear old thing&mdash;and she so ill too!'
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;Snaggs, old fellow&mdash;do you think she has
any knowledge of the aw&mdash;aw&mdash;second sight?'
</p>

<p>
'Why?' inquired Snaggs, with a furtive glance at
me.
</p>

<p>
'I have made up a devilish heavy book on the
Derby, and wondaw rathaw which horse will win,'
said Snobleigh.
</p>

<p>
Snaggs smiled faintly, and reined back his pony.
</p>

<p>
Although at that time only the half of what this
fine gentleman said was understood by me, I gave
him a glance so furious, that after attempting to
survey me coolly through his glass for a second, he
grew pale, smiled, and looked another way.
</p>

<p>
At last, the baronet grew weary of all this; he
pocketed his purse, and stepped into the carriage;
his friends found seats also&mdash;the steps were shut
up&mdash;the door closed, and with its varnished wheels
flashing in the morning sun, away it bowled, the horses,
two fine bays, at a rapid trot, and Snaggs spurring
furiously behind.  Callum and I were left on the
narrow mountain-path with saddened, humbled, and
irritated hearts, that smarted and rebelled under the
loftiness of tone which the possession of 'a little
filthy lucre,' enabled these <i>blasé</i> voluptuaries to
assume towards us, who were the old hereditary sons
of the soil.
</p>

<p>
'I would ask you to my hut,' said Callum, 'but for
three days no food has been there.'
</p>

<p>
'Come, Callum&mdash;come with me, and though I have
but little to offer, that little shall be shared with you
and a thousand welcomes to it,' said I, and we turned
our steps together homeward.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
WHICH TREATS OF MANY THINGS.
</h3>

<p>
I have said that Laura Everingham was pretty rather
than beautiful, and graceful rather than dignified.  I
may add, that she was winning rather than witty;
but her friend Miss Clavering was both beautiful and
brilliant; and frequently as I had seen both these
attractive English girls, it was Laura, whose gentleness,
voice, and face, made the most vivid impression
on me; and thus, with my mind full of her image, I
returned slowly and thoughtfully towards the old
jointure-house of Glen Ora.
</p>

<p>
Three weeks passed away.
</p>

<p>
The great service we, or Callum, rather, had rendered
to Sir Horace, was forgotten, for the adventures
of that night had given the baronet a violent and
all-absorbing fit of the gout, and a fever which confined
him to bed; and amid his friends, the luxuries which
surrounded him, and the frivolities of fashionable
life, he forgot that save for the fearless heart and
strong arm of Mac Ian he must have perished by the
waters of the Uisc Dhu, without leaving, perhaps, a
trace of his fate behind.  And poor Callum&mdash;he whose
Spartan virtue had declined the proffered reward&mdash;was
often almost starving; for his little crop had
failed; his patches of wheat and potatoes were
blighted, though carefully reared on the sunny side
of Ben Ora; and, like others in the glen, he anticipated
with sorrow and anxiety the usual visit of the
pious and uncompromising Snaggs when the
term-time arrived.
</p>

<p>
My poor mother's health was failing fast, and as it
failed, her spirit sank.  She lacked many comforts
which I was without the means of procuring; and
though old Mhari and her niece Minnie were
unwearying and unremitting in their kindness and
ministry, she seemed to be dying literally by inches,
yet without any visible ailment&mdash;a painful and a
terrible contemplation for me, who, except the people in
the glen, and the ties of blood old Highland custom
and tradition gave between us, had not another
relative in the world; for all my kindred&mdash;ay more than
thirty of them&mdash;had died, as I have said, in the
service of their country.
</p>

<p>
She was passing away from among us, and now,
for her sake, I regretted that my foster-brother had
not stooped to avail himself of the reward proffered
by Sir Horace; for even that small sum would
have been at her service, as honest Callum Mac
Ian loved and revered her as if she had been his
own mother.
</p>

<p>
With such sad, bitter, and humiliating reflections,
the memory of the winning smile, the thankful
glance, and soft pretty manner of Laura Everingham,
struggled hard for mastery; but as weeks rolled on,
these pleasing recollections gave place to a just
emotion of anger, at what I deemed her cold and
haughty neglect of my mother, whom she had neither
visited nor invited to the new house of Glen Ora.
Vague suspicions floated in my mind that Snaggs the
factor was in some degree to blame for this apparent
discourtesy, and these surmises afterwards proved to
be correct.  Moreover, the moustached Captain
Clavering, and his perfumed friend, Mr. Adolphus
Frederick Snobleigh, whom we saw shooting and
deer-stalking on the hill sides, usually passed me with a
nod or glance of recognition, because I was coarsely
clad, and to them seemed but a mountain gilly, though
every bonnet in Glen Ora was veiled at my approach
in reverence to the name I inherited.  But this was
the result of old Celtic sympathies&mdash;the ties of
clanship and kindred, the historical, traditionary, and
poetic veneration of the Highland peasant for the
head of his house, humbled and poor though that
house may be; sympathies deep, bitter, fiery and
enthusiastic, and beyond the comprehension of a
devil-may-care guardsman like Clavering, or an
effeminate <i>blasé parvenu</i>, and man-about-town, like
Snobleigh.
</p>

<p>
Once a liveried lacquey with a well-powdered head
brought a beautiful bouquet of flowers 'with Miss
Everingham's love to Mrs. Captain Mac Innon;' but
as this knock-knee'd gentleman in the red plush
inexpressibles was over-attentive to our pretty Minnie,
her lover Callum flung him out of the front door, and
tore his livery; and such was the report made by
Mr. Jeames Toodles of his reception at the old
jointure-house, that no more messages came from the
family of Sir Horace.
</p>

<p>
Now came the crisis in the fortunes of the cottars
of Glen Ora.  The postman who travelled once weekly
over the mountains, and bore the letters for the
district, in a leathern bag strapped across his back,
brought for each resident, myself included, a notice
that Mr. Ephraim Snaggs would be in the glen on a
certain day, to hold a rent-court, and collect the
arrears; with a brief intimation, that if all demands
were not satisfied in full, the houses would be
destroyed, and the people driven off.  That night, there
went a wail of lamentation through the glen; the
women wept, and the men gazed about them with the
sullen apathy in which a despairing mariner may see
his ship going down into the ocean, for there were
neither remedy nor mercy to be expected.  Our
people were able to live comfortably in the glen, as
for ages their forefathers had done, marrying and
giving in marriage&mdash;increasing and multiplying, till
their corn patches and little green cottages dotted all
the mountain slopes; but curbed by the game-laws,
and thence deprived of those substitutes by which
nature replaced the sterility of the soil&mdash;ruined by
the wanton destruction of the kelp manufacture, and
by having their rents doubled, tripled, and quadrupled
with the deliberate intention that they should be unable
to pay them, and hence afford to the feudal lord
of the land a LEGAL EXCUSE for sweeping them to the
sea-shore, that the glens may be made a wilderness
for game, and their hearths a lair for the deer, the fox,
and the wild cat&mdash;the peasantry found themselves
helpless!  And thus it is, that in virtue of a fragment
of sheepskin, we find men in Scotland, exerting over
their fellow-men a murderous and inhuman tyranny;
such as was never wielded by the worst feudal despots
in the middle ages of Germany, or in the present days
of Russia.  But to resume my story:
</p>

<p>
In addition to our little household, we had now to
support Callum Dhu, who had been afflicted by a
sickness&mdash;I verily believe, the result of mere want
and privation, for he was too proud to acknowledge,
that occasionally days elapsed without his fast being
broken.  He was entitled to four hundred merks
Scots, and a good dram for every fox's head; but as
he was weak and ailing, the foxes got into places
beyond his reach, and rabbits became scarce.  We could
not see Callum starve; for never did brother love
brother more sincerely than my fosterer loved me;
and but for this sentiment, and his ardent regard
for Minnie and his native glen, the poor fellow had
long since abandoned his hut, and joined one of our
eight Highland regiments.
</p>

<p>
Now came 'the day&mdash;the great, the eventful day,'
when Snaggs the factor, accompanied by his clerk
(the latter custodier of a wooden box and a
green-baize bag), both on trotting Highland garrons,
appeared at the lower entrance of the glen, their advance
into which was witnessed by the cottars with greater
excitement, and certainly far more terror than their
forefathers, when beholding the <i>Sliochd Dhiarmed an
Tuirc</i>, numbering a thousand swordsmen under Black
Colin of Rhodez, march through the same pass against
the Mac Innons of Glen Ora, and the Mac Intyres of
Glen O.
</p>

<p>
And now, with the reader's permission, I will
devote a short paragraph to Mr. Snaggs.
</p>

<p>
He was externally a very religious man, and grave
in his deportment, being an elder of a dissenting kirk.
Having been bred to the law in Edinburgh, he
spoke with an extremely English accent, as nothing
Scottish is much in vogue about 'the Parliament
House;' for unfortunately, the language which our
Lowlanders received from their brave ancestors who
came from the Cimbric Chersonese&mdash;a language
in which the sweetest of our poets have sung&mdash;the
language spoken by Mary Queen of Scots, in which
Knox preached, and all our laws are written, is voted
vulgar by the growing 'snobbishness' of the Scottish
people themselves&mdash;excuse the term pray, but I know
of none more suitable&mdash;hence Mr. Snaggs spoke with
a marvellous accent, and it would have been quite in
vain to quote to such as he the words of honest
Ninian Wingate, when he warned John Knox&mdash;'Gif
ye throw curiositie of novationis hes forgot our auld
plane Scottis qwhilk your mither lernit you, in tymes
coming I sall wryt to yow my mynd in Latin, for I
am nocht acquynt with your Southeron.'  Mr. Snaggs
went to kirk thrice on Sunday; he was a member of
various tract-distributing societies, and always wore
a white neckcloth, and scrupulously accurate suit of
black; he was a great believer in whisky-toddy and
the patriotism of the Lord Advocate.  Honesty and
charity were ever in his mouth, but never in his heart
or hand; he never swore by aught save his honour,
which was a somewhat tattered article.  He never
was known to do good by stealth 'and blush to find
it fame;' but he subscribed largely to all <i>printed</i> lists,
especially such as were headed by philanthropic and
noble depopulators.  His keen grey eyes were
expressive alternately of cunning and malevolence,
while his mouth wore a perpetual smile or grin.
Cringing and mean to the rich, Snaggs was a tyrant
and oppressor of the poor, and led the van of that
all-but-organized system of extermination pursued by
certain infamous dukes, marquises, and lairds towards
the poor Highland peasantry; and he was a vehement
advocate for the substitution of bare sheep-walks and
useless game-preserves, instead of glens studded by
little cottages, and teeming with life and rural health,
and peopled by a brave and hardy race, who in the
ranks of war gave place to none, and who, although
they have no feudal charters, are by right of
inheritance the true lords of the soil.
</p>

<p>
Such was the smooth, pious, fawning but terrible
Ephraim Snaggs, who made his appearance in Glen
Ora punctually at eleven o'clock on the appointed
day.  Now we had no longer any hope of remaining
in the old jointure-house, for I do not
believe that anything save a miracle would have
raised fifty pounds among us, and the age of miracles
is past.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
THE RENT COURT.
</h3>

<p>
I shall never forget the emotion of shame that
glowed within me on finding myself compelled to
avoid this miserable worm.
</p>

<p>
'He is coming! he is coming!' exclaimed Minnie,
wringing her hands, as we perceived from the
dining-room window two mounted figures appear in the
gorge of the glen.
</p>

<p>
'Oclion! ochon! ochon!' chorused old Mhari,
lifting up her hands, 'the sorrows that have fallen
upon us would sink the blessed ship of Clanronald.'
</p>

<p>
Callum uttered a hearty oath in Gaelic, and pulled
his bonnet over his knitted brow.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Snaggs dismounted at the door and gave his
green bag to Minnie, on whom he smiled familiarly,
and then perceiving that she was pretty, he pinched
her rosy cheek, and eyed her with a glance that had
more of a leer than benignity in it; but he was
always singularly <i>suave</i> to Minnie.  Being too
indisposed to receive him, my mother remained in
her own room, and I&mdash;knowing that we had not the
cash to meet his demands, took my rod and went
to the Loch nan Spiordan for our supper; as there
the <i>tarr-dhiargan</i>, or red-bellied char, were in great
plenty, and the banks were a favourite ride of Laura
Everingham.  For Snaggs I left a note, filled with
the old excuses, of wet weather, bad crops, corn
destroyed by the south-west wind, sheep with the
rot, cattle with the murrain, hard times, and so forth.
He read it over&mdash;smiled faintly, and after carefully
folding and docketing it, he seated himself at a table
which was placed in front of the house under an
ancient lime, on the branches of which many a
cateran from the isles had swung in the wind.
There his clerk arranged his papers, and while the
poor dejected defaulters came slowly down the glen
communing sorrowfully together, Mr. Snaggs regaled
himself on bread, cheese, and a dram which Callum
Dhu placed before him, with more of old Highland
hospitality than the factor merited.
</p>

<p>
The excitement was general; thirty-two families
the remnant of our once powerful tribe, all linked
and connected together by ties of blood, descent, and
misfortune, hovered on the brink of ruin.
</p>

<p>
One by one, the tenants approached bonnet in
hand, and before this man of power and parchment
bent their heads that under braver auspices would
not have stooped to the whistle of a cannon-ball.
Poor people! their tremulous but earnest excuses for
the lack of money, though their small rents varied
only from fifteen to twenty pounds or so, and the
half-uttered prayers for mercy, from those who could
no more pay this, than liquidate the National Debt,
were all the same.
</p>

<p>
One named Ian Mac Raonuil had been ten years
a soldier, and though thrice wounded, was unpensioned,
as there was a break in his service, having
enlisted twice.  Latterly he had earned a scanty
subsistence by fishing in the salt lochs beyond Ben
Ora; he was now sixty years of age, and had seven
children.  He could pay the old rent, but was
totally unable to pay the new, which was exactly
triple what had ever been paid for his poor cottage
within the memory of man.  The factor shook his
legal head&mdash;-made an entry in his black-book&mdash;handed
to the haggard-eyed Mac Raonuil (as he did
to all) a pious tract, and summoned the next on his
fatal roll.
</p>

<p>
'Alisdair Mac Gouran.'
</p>

<p>
A fine-looking old Highlander, upwards of seventy
years of age stepped forward.  His tall and erect
figure was clad in coarse blue cloth, and his long
locks, which were white as snow, glittered in the
sun, when he politely removed his bonnet before
the grand vizier of the new proprietor, with the
usual greeting, as he knew no language but Gaelic,
</p>

<p>
'Failte na maiduin duibh'&mdash;(Hail&mdash;good morning
to you).
</p>

<p>
'<i>You</i> have your rent at least, I hope, Alisdair?'
said Snaggs, with a grin on his thin lips.
</p>

<p>
'I have the old rent,' replied the cotter with a
sickly smile.
</p>

<p>
'But the <i>new</i>?'
</p>

<p>
'A chial! what would you be asking of me?  I
have the old rent, and by the sweat of my brow and
the toil of my children's tender hands have I earned
it.  It is here.  Have mercy on us, Ephraim Snaggs,
and do not double the rent.  You stand between us
and Sir Horace&mdash;between us and starvation.  He
will be advised by you for good or for evil&mdash;he is
an Englishman, and like a Lowlander, can know no
better.  You are aware that my croft is small, and
that my eight children have to support themselves
by fishing; but the famine was sore three years ago;
our potatoes failed, and as you know well our little
crop of wheat was literally thrashed on the mountain
by the wind.  All that remained was devoured by
the game of the Duchess.  I then fell into arrears.
I, like my fathers before me, for more generations
than I can number, have regularly paid rent and
kain to the uttermost farthing&mdash;for God and Mary's
sake, take pity on us now, Mr. Snaggs.  Accept the
old rental, but spare us the new&mdash;for a little time at
least, or eleven human beings, including my old and
bedridden mother, now past her ninetieth year, will
be homeless and houseless!'
</p>

<p>
'Mac Gouran,' said Mr. Snaggs, with mock
impressiveness, while his malevolent eye belied his
bland voice; 'the divine Walton says, "can <i>you</i> or
any man charge God that he hath not given enough
to make life happy?"'
</p>

<p>
'God gave, but the duke, the lord, and the earl,
have taken away,' answered the Highlander, sharply.
</p>

<p>
Snaggs grinned again&mdash;took the money, gave a
receipt, and with it a printed tract.  Then he made
another entry in his fatal book, and a groan escaped
the breast of Mac Gouran, for too well did he know
what that entry meant.  His cot was in a picturesque
place where Sir Horace wished to plant some coppice;
so the humble roof, where twenty generations of brave
and hardy peasants had reared their sturdy broods,
was doomed to be swept away.
</p>

<p>
All who came forward had the same, or nearly
the same, excuses to make.
</p>

<p>
Gillespie Ruadh&mdash;or Red Archibald&mdash;Minnie's
uncle, was also in default; but Snaggs, who had
cast favourable eyes on his pretty niece, spoke to
him with such excessive suavity that old Archy was
quite puzzled.
</p>

<p>
Many professed their readiness and ability to pay
the old rent, but their total incapacity to meet the
new and exorbitant one, which they knew too well
was but the plea, the pretence, on which they were
to be driven from the glen, that it might be well
stocked with deer and black cock.  The last
summoned by the factor was Callum Dhu Mac Ian.
</p>

<p>
My fosterer, who was viewed as a kind of champion
by the people, pressed the hand of Minnie to
reassure her, and with one stride appeared before
Snaggs in his tattered Highland dress.  He carried
a gun in his hand, and had a couple of red foxes,
hanging dead over his left shoulder.  A dark cloud
was hovering on Callum's brow and a lurid spark
was gleaming in his eye, both indicative of the fire
he was smothering in his heart&mdash;a fire fanned by the
lamentations of the people, who were now collected
in little family groups and communing together.
</p>

<p>
'How are you, Callum?' asked Snaggs, with a
sardonic grin, holding out his left hand, as his right
held a pen: but Callum drew back, saying proudly,
</p>

<p>
'Thank you&mdash;but I would not take the <i>left</i> hand
of a king.'
</p>

<p>
'Well then, neer-do-weel,' said Snaggs, surveying
the tall and handsome hunter with an eye of
ill-disguised antipathy, 'what have you to say?'
</p>

<p>
'I am no neer-do-weel, Mr. Snaggs,' replied Callum
loftily, and disdaining to touch his bonnet or bend
his head.
</p>

<p>
'Pay up then,' was the pithy rejoinder.
</p>

<p>
'I never was asked for rent before.  I and mine
have dwelt rent-free under the Mac Innons of Glen
Ora since these hills had a name.  We were hunters,
father and son in succession, as you know well, and
paid neither rent nor kain; we owed nothing to the
chief but an armed man's service in time of war and
feud; so I see no reason why it should be otherwise
now.'
</p>

<p>
'I am afraid, my fine fellow, that the sheriff and
the law will tell you another story.'
</p>

<p>
'D&mdash;n both, with all my heart!'
</p>

<p>
'What&mdash;dare you say so of the law?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;and it must learn, that instead of me paying
to Sir Horace, he must, as his betters did of old,
pay to me a sum for every fox's head I bring to his
hall.'
</p>

<p>
'You are three years in arrear, Callum.'
</p>

<p>
'Three hundred and more, perhaps, by your way
of reckoning; but the last proprietor is dead&mdash;our
debts died with him.'
</p>

<p>
'Your idea is a very common one among these
ignorant people,' rejoined Snaggs, with a smile on
his mouth and a glare in his wolfish eye; 'but I
must condescend to inform you, that the law of
Scotland says, when a landlord or overlord dies, the
rents past due belong to his executors.  Sir Horace
took the estate with all its debts, and the half-year's
rent then current, with all arrears, are his due; and
this rule applies especially to grass-farms, as you
will find in the case of Elliot <i>versus</i> Elliot, before the
Lords of Council and Session in 1792; and the landlord
has a hypothec for his rent over the crop and
stocking; hence your furniture and plenishing are
the property of Sir Horace Everingham.'
</p>

<p>
'Ha-ha-ha!  A broken table, two creepies, a kail-pot
and crocan; an old cashcroim, some mouldy potatoes,
and a milk bowie!'
</p>

<p>
'And remember,' added Snaggs, impressively,
'when a tenant who is bankrupt, remains, notwithstanding
a notice to remove, the landlord may forcibly
eject him in six days, as you will find in a case before
the Lords of Council and Session in 1756.  This is
the wisdom, not the cunning of the law, my dear
friend, for, as the learned Johnson says, "cunning
differs from wisdom as much as twilight from open
day."'
</p>

<p>
'A nis! a nis!' cried Callum, in fierce irony, as he
stamped his right foot passionately on the ground,
and struck the butt of his gun on the turf; 'Snake! by
the Black Stone of Scone you come to it now!'
</p>

<p>
Minnie clung in terror to her fiery lover.
</p>

<p>
'Laoighe mo chri,' she whispered, 'be calm and
tempt him not!'
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Snaggs, I am but a half-lettered Highlandman,
and know not what you mean; but this I know&mdash;and
here I speak for my chief Glen Ora, as well
as for his people&mdash;the sun shines as bright, and
the woods are as green, as ever they were twenty
centuries ago, and yet we starve where our fathers
lived in plenty!  Why is this?'
</p>

<p>
'Because you are a pack of lazy and idle fellows.'
</p>

<p>
'We are not,' retorted Callum, fiercely; 'the dun
hills swarm with fatted deer; the green woods are
alive with game, and the blue rivers teem with fish;
but who among us dares to use a net or gun?  For
now the land, with all that is in its waters, its woods,
and in the air, belong to the stranger.  God was kind
to the poor Celts, Mr. Snaggs, in the days before you
were born,' he continued, with unintentional irony.
'He gave us all those things, because He saw that
the land, though beautiful, was very barren; but you,
and such as you, have robbed us of them, and one
day God will call you to an account for this.  Listen:
in the days of the kelp manufacture, we made twenty
thousand tons of it annually, here on the western
coast alone&mdash;ay, we <i>lazy Highlandmen</i>, raising <i>two
hundred thousand pounds sterling every year</i>.  This work,
with a cow's milk, butter, and cheese, a few potatoes,
and a few sheep, for food and clothes, kept many a
large family in happiness, in health, and comfort;
rents were paid strictly and regularly in rent and
kain, and arrears were never heard of.  But the
Parliament, influenced by the English manufacturers,
DESTROYED us by taking the duty off barilla; and
when Lord Binning said, that a hundred thousand
clansmen in the West would starve, the English
Chancellor of the Exchequer replied&mdash;"Let them starve&mdash;I
care not!" may God and St. Colme forgive his soul
the sin.  There were only forty-five Scotsmen&mdash;time-serving
and tongue-tied Scotsmen&mdash;in that House,
opposed to six hundred wordy Englishmen, so how
could our case be otherwise?  Now, this was only
thirty years ago, and since then arrears, ruin, misery,
and famine have fallen upon the people of the glens;
the castles of their chiefs have become English
grouse-lodges, and the West Highlands are well nigh a
voiceless wilderness, from the Mull of Cantyre to the Kyle
of Duirness&mdash;two hundred and fifty good miles,
Mr. Snaggs.'
</p>

<p>
'Where the deuce did <i>you</i> pick up all this stuff&mdash;this
Lay of the Last Outlaw?' sneered Snaggs, with
unfeigned surprise, while a murmur of assent from
the poor tenantry followed Callum's words.
</p>

<p>
'I could tell you more, Snaggs, esquire and factor,'
replied Callum, still maintaining his fire; 'esquire
means nothing now in this world, though <i>factor</i> may
have a terrible signification in the next; I can tell
you, that these poor people whom you are about to
evict&mdash;for I know their doom is sealed&mdash;have a right
in the soil superior to that claimed by any landlord
or overlord either.  The Lowlanders, like the English,
were feudal serfs, while we&mdash;the Celts&mdash;were freemen,
and our land belonged not to the chiefs, but to
<i>the people</i>; it was ours; but lawyers came with their
feu-charters and damnable legalities, and then the
patriarchal clansman became what you find him now,
something between a slave and an outcast&mdash;a wretch
to be retained or expelled at the will of his landlord.
The chief was a thing of our breath, whom we could
make or unmake; but the land, with its mountains,
woods, and waters, was the unalienable birthright of
the people; it was their home&mdash;their dwelling-place&mdash;their
grave!  The King of Scotland could neither
give it nor take it away, for it was the patrimony of
the tribes of the Gael; and it was for this patriarchal
right in the land that John of Moidart and Ranald
Galda died at the battle of Blairleine!'
</p>

<p>
'And so the land belonged to the Gael,' continued
Snaggs, with his calm sneer; 'but who gave it to them?'
</p>

<p>
'God!' replied Callum, lifting his bonnet with
reverence; 'but no doubt, Mr. Snaggs, a lawyer like
you will have more faith in feu-charters, and bonds,
and bank-notes, than in Him; it is only to be
expected of one of your dirty trade; and now I have
only a few words more.'
</p>

<p>
'I am glad to hear it.'
</p>

<p>
'It would be a blessing for Scotland if you, and
every man such as you, were groping among the
weeds at the bottom of Loch Ora, each with a
good-sized stone at his neck; and it would be a greater
blessing if the unwieldy estates of her absentee
proprietors were held by residents who would spend
their rents&mdash;not in London and in Paris&mdash;but among
the people from whom they are drawn, and on the
soil from whence they are raised; and for this reason,
Mr. Snaggs, and many others, the sooner Scotland is
rid of her fustian chiefs and so-called nobility the
better for herself.  So much, Mr. Snaggs, for the
Lay of the Last Outlaw!'
</p>

<p>
With these words Callum gave the table a kick,
that sent it flying right over the head of Snaggs,
whose religious tracts, rent-books, papers, and
luncheon, were scattered in every direction by this
champion of Celtic rights, who shouldered his
fowling-piece, and hastened up the glen to meet me; and
relate all that had passed.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
MINNIE.
</h3>

<p>
Though few men in their senses ever think of consulting
Hansard, I may mention, that the debates in 1823
will be found to corroborate much of what Callum
advanced in his own peculiar way.
</p>

<p>
Minnie, who was an amiable and good-natured
girl, became alarmed by the sudden violence of her
lover, and its probable effect upon the temper of
Mr. Snaggs; she busied herself in collecting all that
worthy's papers, dockets, and religious tracts, which
had been spilled and scattered abroad by the
unexpected capsize of the table, at which he had been
seated with much legal dignity and assumed
benignity of aspect.
</p>

<p>
'Thank you, my good girl,' said Snaggs, on recovering
his breath and lawyer-like composure; 'thank
you&mdash;I shall not forget this.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank you, sir, a thousand times,' replied Minnie,
curtsying very low, as she thought of her old uncle's
unpaid arrears.
</p>

<p>
Minnie Mac Omish was a very pretty girl; under a
little lace cap, her silky brown hair was braided in
two thick masses over her temples and little ears, and
enough remained to form a heavy knot behind, where
two very bewildering little curls, that were the joy
of Callum's heart, played upon her plump white
neck.  Her eyes were large, blue, and expressive;
her bust full and perfect; her figure firm and
graceful, and a healthy bloom, that came with the free
mountain air, tinged her rounded cheeks with red.
</p>

<p>
'You are a good girl,' continued the factor, slipping
a half-crown into her hand, 'and this will buy
a ribbon for your pretty neck,' he added, kissing her
cheek, much to Minnie's surprise.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Mr. Snaggs,' said she, anxiously, and with
tears, as the worthy elder still lingered near her,
after mounting his pony, 'I hope you will forget
Callum's fury, and show some mercy to my poor old
uncle, Gillespie Ruadh&mdash;he is old&mdash;his wife is sick,
and they have seven children.'
</p>

<p>
'The mystical number seems to be the established
one in Glen Ora, my dear,' said Snaggs, retaining the
girl's hand in his, despite her timid efforts to
withdraw it; 'by-the-by, lass, can you tell me how many
cattle are in the glen?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'You do not know?'
</p>

<p>
'We never count them, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'It is so unlucky.'
</p>

<p>
'Whew!&mdash;how?'
</p>

<p>
'Some would be sure to die after we had reckoned
them; and St. Colme knows we have few enough for
the poor people.'
</p>

<p>
This was said, of course, in Gaelic, but Snaggs
understood it, for, pressing her hand, he added, more
kindly,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'My good girl, I wish I had you in my own house
at Inverness (I am a quiet old bachelor), that I
might teach you the folly of believing in such
personages as St. Colme, and in these old remnants of
popery and superstition, which warp the ideas of the
people, and prevent the diffusion of a purer religion
into these barbarous districts.  Be assured, my dear
girl, "that when religion is neglected," as the divine
Blair says, "there can be no regular or steady
practice of the duties of morality."'
</p>

<p>
'But how about my poor old uncle, sir?' she urged
again, with tears in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Gillespie Ruadh is long&mdash;very long in arrear,'
said Snaggs, pretending to consult his note-book,
while squinting over it, at the pretty face that was
so anxiously upturned to his; 'let me see&mdash;let me
see&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'In arrears?'
</p>

<p>
'Ay, heavily&mdash;not a payment has he made since
Whitsunday was two years.'
</p>

<p>
'Alas!  I know that,' said Minnie, beginning to
weep.
</p>

<p>
'Now, don't spoil those pretty eyes of yours, Minnie&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What shall I tell my uncle?'
</p>

<p>
'Oho,' whispered Snaggs, over whose eyes there
shot a strange and baleful gleam; 'he asked you to
intercede with me?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir,' replied Minnie, with hesitation.
</p>

<p>
'Meet me to-night at dusk&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Where?'
</p>

<p>
'At the Clach-na-greiné,' said Snaggs, sinking his
voice lower still.
</p>

<p>
'But why at dusk, and why at such a lonely place?'
</p>

<p>
'Is not one place the same as another&mdash;when the
spirit of God is everywhere?  But tell no one of this;
and when there, I will give you a message&mdash;ay, it
may be a receipt in full for Gillespie.'
</p>

<p>
'Heaven will reward you, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'It rewards all who have faith, even as a grain of
mustard-seed, Minnie,' said the factor, touching his
garron with his riding-switch.  'Can you read
English, Minnie?'
</p>

<p>
'A little, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'Then take these tracts, "The Sinner's Deathbed"&mdash;"The
Pious Policeman"&mdash;"The God-fearing Footman"&mdash;read
them to your friends, and say they were
given by Snaggs the factor, whom they hate so
much&mdash;and see that you have all the contents by rote
to-night, when we meet at moonrise near the
Clach-na-greiné.  But say not a word to any human being on
the subject, or the sequel may prove the worse for
your uncle Gillespie Ruadh&mdash;do not forget Minnie&mdash;at
moonrise;' and with these words and an impressive
gleam in his glassy deceitful eyes, Mr. Snaggs trotted
down the glen to join the minister in prayer at the
bedside of a dying cotter, and thereafter to dine with
Sir Horace at the new manor-house of Glen Ora.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
THE RED PRIEST OF APPLECROSS.
</h3>

<p>
I heard, with the utmost alarm, the relation of all
that had passed, and felt assured that my doom and
the doom of our people were sealed.  To Mr. Snaggs,
Callum had said nothing more than I would have
said, but the chances are that, had I encountered him,
my bearing might have been more violent.
</p>

<p>
'The glen will be swept like Glentuirc,' said
Callum, as we descended the hill slowly and thoughtfully;
'swept bare as my hand, devil a doubt of it.'
</p>

<p>
'And the old jointure-house, Callum&mdash;our last
home on earth&mdash;sick and ailing as my poor mother is,
how is she ever to be got out of it?'
</p>

<p>
'Never alive, I fear me.'
</p>

<p>
I shuddered at his answer, for he as well as I knew
the strange old tradition connected with it.
</p>

<p>
Lachlan Mohr Mac Innon, about twenty years
before his fall at Worcester, had been seized by a
covenanting and reformatory spirit, and while the
fervour lasted, had demolished an ancient chapel of
St. Colme, and with the stones thereof, built the said
jointure-house.  This was considered an act of
sacrilege so deep, that the Mac Donalds of Keppoch, and
other Catholic tribes, were on the point of marching
in hostile array to Glen Ora, when the influence of a
wandering monk of the Scottish mission restrained
them.  This personage, whose adventures have been
given to the world as the Capuchino Scozzese, and
who is still remembered in Ross-shire as the Red
Priest of Applecross, cursed the deed in Latin and
Gaelic, and predicted, that as Lachlan Mohr had built
a house for the dowagers of his family to live in, not
one should ever <i>die</i> there; and strange enough,
though it had been inhabited for about two hundred
years, no member of our family was ever known to
pay the debt of nature within it; though many who
were sick, ailing, or longing for death, after dwelling
long there, perished by violent ends or sudden
diseases elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
Angus Mac Innon, who fought at Culloden, left a
widow, a daughter of Barcaldine, who attained a vast
age, and lived beyond a century, attenuated,
bed-ridden, sickly, and querulous, in the last stages of
emaciation and second childhood.  Longing for a
crisis to her sufferings, in the same year in which
her present Majesty ascended the throne, she insisted
on being conveyed on a pallet into the open air, and,
like the Lady May, of Cadboll, to defy fate, and test
the truth of the terrible prediction.  Four of our
people, Alisdair Mac Gouran, Ian Mac Raonuil, Red
Gillespie, and Mac Ian, the father of my fosterer,
bore her slowly and carefully on a palliasse; and
whether it might be the result of fancy acting on a
highly-nervous temperament, or the weakness of a
system worn away with age, I know not; but to the
no small horror of her bearers, the aged widow of
Angus expired at the instant she was passing the
threshold.
</p>

<p>
Now, my mother had long been sickly and almost
bedridden, and thus though I could scarcely put
much faith in the prediction of the Red Priest of
Applecross, which had been impressed upon me in
childhood by my nurse, the mother of Callum Dhu,
as something to be spoken of in whispers, and
thought of with awe, yet I looked forward with
vague apprehension to our expulsion from the house;
as she was wont to affirm that she was so feeble and
worn by time, that the life in her was not natural,
and that if once she passed <i>the door</i> of the fated
mansion, her doom would be similar to that of Angus'
widow.  A strange terror seized me with this thought,
for my mother was my only tie to the glen, to my
country&mdash;to existence itself!
</p>

<p>
Weary of dark conjectures, and with a heart full of
dim forebodings, while Callum and Minnie were in
another part of the house, I entered my mother's
little parlour.  She was again seated at a little tripod
table, with her bible and her knitting before her.
</p>

<p>
'You know all, Allan,' said she, anxiously.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, mother,' said I, and flinging myself into a
chair, I pressed my hands upon my temples, and then
we relapsed into moody silence.
</p>

<p>
My mother sighed deeply.
</p>

<p>
What need was there for words to express our
anxious thoughts?  From time to time I gazed
earnestly at my only parent&mdash;my only living relative.
Age had traced deep lines upon her pale sad face;
but care had planted furrows deeper still.  We sat
long silent; at last she said in a trembling voice&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'The evil day is coming, Allan, when the fire on
this hearth&mdash;so long boasted as the highest in
Scotland&mdash;will be quenched at last.'
</p>

<p>
I bit my lips till the blood came.  Poverty had
made me as powerless as if a wall of adamant
enclosed me, and I could see no means of extrication
from our present difficulties.
</p>

<p>
'Even money if we had it would not satisfy them,
mother,' said I.
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because Sir Horace is resolved on having this
house pulled down, and a new shooting-box built in
its stead.'
</p>

<p>
'A little time, Allan&mdash;dear Allan&mdash;would have
made <i>me</i> least independent of this poor dwelling,
unless indeed the curse that was laid on Lachlan
Mhor&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, mother, do not speak or think of that!' I
exclaimed, hastily, while half kneeling and half
embracing her, 'there is to be a gathering on the Braes,
and a shooting-match.  Miss Everingham gives a
hundred sovereigns&mdash;think of that, mother, a hundred
sovereigns to the best rifle-shot.  I may win them, or
Callum, and that prize would pay a portion of our
debts; hear me, mother, dear mother! and if I lose,
there is still hope for us in Callum.  We have done
this man, Sir Horace, a service&mdash;Callum Dhu saved
him from a dreadful death at the Black Water&mdash;might
we not ask a little time, a little mercy at least, for
your sake, mother?'
</p>

<p>
'No!  I would rather perish than stoop to sue from
such as he, for mercy or for grace.  No, no; if it is
written in the book of fate that the stranger shall rule
here, then let our glen be swept bare as the Braes of
Lochaber.  But oh, <i>mo mhac! mo mhac!</i> (my son! my
son!) your home and grave will lie in a land that is
distant far from mine.'
</p>

<p>
'Mo mhathair! mo mhathair!' I exclaimed in a
wild burst of grief at her words, which I vainly
endeavour to give here literally in English; 'even
when you are gone, I cannot go to that distant land
beyond the Atlantic.  There is no heather there, nor
aught that speaks of home; the broad salt sea shall
never roll between your resting-place and mine.  I
will trust to the honesty, the manliness, and the
sympathy of Sir Horace; he will never be so cruel as to
unhouse the widow of a brave Highland officer, who
carried the colours of the Black Watch at the Battle
of the Pyramids, and led three assaults at Burgos and
Badajoz.'
</p>

<p>
My mother was a Scottish matron of the old school&mdash;a
genuine Highlander, with all a Highlander's
impulsive spirit, warmth of heart and temper&mdash;their
pride and their prejudices if you will; but honest
prejudices withal, of that bluff olden time which scorned
and spurned the cold-blooded conventionality of the
new.  My suggestions or hopes of temporizing with
Sir Horace, whom she could never be brought to view
otherwise than as a sorner in the land, and usurper
of our patrimony, though the poor man had bought it
legally, honestly, and fairly at its then market-price,
brought on such a paroxysm of irritation, sorrow, and
weakness, that I became seriously alarmed for her life,
and committed her to the care of Minnie and old
Mhari, whose <i>fion-na-uisc a batha</i>, or wine distilled from
the birch, was considered in Glen Ora a sovereign
remedy 'for all the ills that flesh is heir to;' and was
deemed moreover very conducive to strength and
longevity.
</p>

<p>
I was now summoned by Callum, who earnestly
begged my company, if I could spare an hour with
him.

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
THE STONE OF THE SUN.
</h3>

<p>
I have now arrived at a point in the history of that
acute factor, pious elder, and severe moralist,
Mr. Snaggs, which I would willingly, but cannot omit,
without leaving in my narrative a hiatus which every
dramatist, novelist, historian, and biographer would
unanimously condemn.  With the suspicion natural
to a Celt, Minnie mistrusted Ephraim Snaggs, and
informed Callum of the proposed meeting.
</p>

<p>
Callum's eyes flashed fire! he grasped his skene,
and bit his lips, with a dark expression on his brow;
for it was well known in the district that two
handsome girls had already been wiled by Snaggs to
distant towns, where, after a time, all trace of them
was lost; and when questioned by their friends (he
had taken care to evict and expatriate their relations),
he had only groaned, turned up his eyes, twiddled his
thumbs, and quoted Blair.
</p>

<p>
The peculiarity of his request, the solitude of the
place, and its traditionary character, excited the
keenest suspicion in the mind of Callum Dhu, and he
begged of me to accompany him to the trysting-place,
to which we accordingly proceeded, and there ensconced
ourselves among the thick broom, juniper-bushes,
and long wavy bracken, about an hour or so
after sunset.
</p>

<p>
In a wild and solitary rift or ravine, that opened
at the back of Ben Ora, and the rugged sides of which
were covered by the light feathery mountain-ash, the
silver birch, the hazel, and the alder, amid which the
roe and the fallow-deer made their lair, stood the
Clach-na-greiné, or <i>stone of the sun</i>.  A huge
misshapen block, on which some quaint figures and
runes or words in an ancient and barbarous language
were discernible; it was a relic of the Druids, whose
religion, a corruption of the older faith of the Magi,
had inspired them to worship the God of Day as the
essence of fire.  Here had the spirit of Loda
descended on their souls, and here in latter times the
posterity of Mac Ionhuin (or the Son of Love) were
wont to meet in arms, to hail and inaugurate their
young chiefs; here justice was administered, and the
guilty were flung into the Poul-a-baidh, or drowning-pool;
here the Red Priest of Applecross anathematized
the sacrilege of Lachlan Mohr; and here in
'the glimpses of the moon,' the famous white stag of
Loch Ora, which was believed to be bullet-proof,
and to have a miraculous longevity, was seen at
times.
</p>

<p>
In the centre of this obelisk was a round hole,
through which the lovers of the district had been
wont for ages to join hands in testimony of their
mutual betrothal: this formed a strong and sacred
tie of mutual fidelity, which none had been known
to break without suffering a violent death.
</p>

<p>
It happened as old Mhari had told me a hundred
times, and as Callum Dhu was ready to affirm on
oath, that among the men who followed my father
into the ranks of the Black Watch, there was one
who had betrothed himself solemnly to a girl of the
glen, through the hole of the Clach-na-greiné.
Forgetting both him and her trothplight, this girl fell
in love with a handsome stranger whom she met at
a harvest-home in Glentuirc.  He danced with her
repeatedly, and whispered of her beauty and of his
passion until her head was turned, and her heart
so far won, that he persuaded her to cross the
mountain of Ben Ora with him; but her confidence being
mingled with fear, she begged of a companion to
follow them a little way.  The moon was bright,
and as they proceeded, she observed with growing
alarm that he carefully avoided every stream and
rill of running water, and that his face, though manly
and beautiful, was deathly pale in the white
moonlight.  They descended into the ravine, and anon
were seen in the full blaze of the moon, near the
great rough column of the Clach-na-greiné.  A
shadowy cloud obscured it for a time.  When it
passed away, the maiden and her pale lover had
disappeared.  The Druid obelisk stood on its grassy
mound in silence and loneliness.  The damsel was
never seen again.  Her earthly lover also proved
false; he married a Spanish wife, and after escaping
the whole Peninsular war, was killed at the side of
old Ian Mac Raonuil by the <i>last</i> shot that was fired
from the hill of Toulouse.
</p>

<p>
A hundred such traditions combined to make the
place wild and unearthly.  The path to it from Glen
Ora lay through a skeleton forest of old fir-trees,
which, being entirely denuded of bark and foliage,
were white, bleached, and ghastly in aspect; while
the stone was generally covered by numbers of the
hideous reptile which is known in some pails of the
Highlands as the <i>bratag</i>, and is spotted black and
white, and when eaten by cattle, causes them to
swell and die.
</p>

<p>
But enough of the Clach-na-greiné.
</p>

<p>
Minnie had not been many minutes seated on a
fragment of rock near it, and had barely exchanged
the appointed signal with Callum&mdash;a verse of a song,
to which he replied by a low whistle&mdash;when
Mr. Snaggs, who had left his pony among the blasted
pines, was seen hastening to the rendezvous with a
cat-like step and stealthy eye.
</p>

<p>
'I am punctual, you will perceive, my dear girl,'
said he, taking her hand kindly in his; 'the broad
white moon seems just to touch the huge black
shoulder of Ben Ora, and throws the shadow of that
grim obelisk along this horrid ravine.  If one were
to shout here, would the sound be heard in Glen
Ora, think you?'
</p>

<p>
'No, sir,' replied Minnie, with a shudder.
</p>

<p>
'You are very confident or courageous, my dear
Minnie, to venture so far to meet <i>me</i>,' said he, in his
most winning tone.  We were close by and heard
everything.
</p>

<p>
'Courage is nothing new in Glen Ora,' said
Minnie.
</p>

<p>
'But your people belonged to Glentuirc?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, of old,' answered Minnie, proudly; 'the
Mac Omishes of Chaistal Omish.'
</p>

<p>
'A most euphonious name&mdash;are you sure?'
</p>

<p>
'Do you doubt it?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;for so beautiful a face as yours, Minnie
never came of the race of Glentuirc.'
</p>

<p>
'They were braver than they were bonnie, perhaps,
Mr. Snaggs,' said Minnie, with reserve.
</p>

<p>
'But now about your uncle's farm, Minnie&mdash;it lies
with yourself to keep Gillespie Fatadh in the glen
and it lies with you to level his cottage to the earth
and drive him into a Lowland workhouse, or to the
distant shores of America.'
</p>

<p>
'With <i>me</i>?' was the breathless query.
</p>

<p>
'Sit down on this green bank and listen to me.
We must be wary, my dear girl, in treating with the
denizens of this glen, for they are sinful ones&mdash;sloth
is sin, and they are slothful,' said Mr. Snaggs,
drawing close to her side, and patting one of her pretty
hands with his right hand, while it was firmly
clutched by his left; 'we must be wary&mdash;religion
is the life of the world, and wickedness is always its
own punishment.'
</p>

<p>
'Sir?' was the perplexed interjection of Minnie.
</p>

<p>
'I was about to remark, my dear,' resumed the
moralist, putting an arm round the waist of the girl,
who became flushed, and who trembled violently,
'that we should take care of the beginnings of sin;
but as the divine Wilson remarks, "nobody is
exceedingly nicked all at once;" thus I might kiss
you, as I do now&mdash;so might a young man; but I do
so, with all the emotions of a father stirred within
me&mdash;yes Minnie, the emotions of a father, an elder,
and a factor; yet were a young man to do this, as
the divine Blair remarks&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'But about my uncle's farm?' urged poor Minnie,
in great perplexity; 'we have long expected a rich
cousin from India, where, as his letters said, his
fortune and his liver were growing larger every
day; but he has never appeared&mdash;and then my
uncle omitted to sow his corn last year in such a
way as to save it from the birds and fairies.'
</p>

<p>
It was now Mr. Snaggs' turn to look perplexed.
</p>

<p>
'From the fairies?' said he.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;for after a field is sown, our farmers mix
some grain and sand together, and scatter it
broadcast, saying at every handful, "the sand for the
fairies, and the corn for the birds;" and those mixed
grains become all that the birds and fairies take.
But the minister told him that this was a sinful
superstition&mdash;so the crop rotted in the ground, or
was destroyed between the Marquis's grouse and the
mildew.'
</p>

<p>
'Hush&mdash;did you not hear something stir among
these bushes?' said Snaggs, with alarm, as Callum
raised, and ducked down his head suddenly; 'pooh! a
polecat or a blackcock&mdash;listen to me, Minnie; I
am always kind to <i>you</i>, whatever the glensmen may
say of me.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'Seldom is there a time, that I come over the
hills from Inverness, without bringing something
for you&mdash;a ribbon, a rosette, a gaud or a
gown-piece&mdash;eh.'
</p>

<p>
'True, sir&mdash;and many, many thanks for your
kindness to a poor girl like me.'
</p>

<p>
'Not at all&mdash;not at all, when she is so sweet and
pretty, Minnie.'
</p>

<p>
'Sir!'
</p>

<p>
'Do you not understand me?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'Then give me another kiss to begin with.'
</p>

<p>
Minnie innocently enough tendered her soft cheek,
to which the fatherly Snaggs applied his lips like
a leech, and his eyes began to sparkle, as he
surveyed the fine slope of her shoulders and contour of
her bust.  He became excited, and retaining one of
her hands in his, clasped her tightly by the waist.
</p>

<p>
'I have ever been kind to your uncle, Minnie.'
</p>

<p>
She was about to break away, but these words
restrained her, and she gazed anxiously into the
eyes of Snaggs, who, therefore, kissed her so tenderly,
that I had much ado to retain Callum in his lair
among the long bracken.  Poor Minnie, in her
distress, looked beautiful&mdash;her face was so full of
expression.
</p>

<p>
'I have kept Gillespie Ruadh in his farm without
raising its rent, which would have been rather futile,
as he has not paid a sixpence to me for these past
two years.'
</p>

<p>
'God will reward you, sir,' said Minnie, weeping.
</p>

<p>
'Cannot you reward me too, Minnie?'
</p>

<p>
'I, sir&mdash;a poor girl without a halfpenny in the
world!'
</p>

<p>
'You.  Would you not like to leave the glen and
enter into the service of a lady in the Lowlands.  I
know one, a fine and motherly old dame, whose
strict, moral, and religious principles&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;no, I could not leave Glen Ora and the Mac
Innons.'
</p>

<p>
'The Mac Innons,' laughed Snaggs, 'will soon be
but a memory here: long ere this day twelve months,
the grass will grow is green on their hearths, as it
waves on the hearths of Glentuirc.'
</p>

<p>
'Then I will still have Callum Dhu,' murmured
Minnie, in a voice that trembled.
</p>

<p>
'Callum Dhu,' reiterated Snaggs, with scornful
impatience; 'what is he that you should regret
him?'
</p>

<p>
'My betrothed husband,' said Minnie, with honest
pride; 'and none can reap in harvest or handle the
cashcroimh like he; but he preferred to be a hunter
like his fathers before him; and at shinty, wrestling,
racing, tossing the stone, the hammer, or the caber,
there is no one on the Braes of Loch Ora like Callum
Dhu Mac Ian.'
</p>

<p>
'Stuff!  These qualities, lassie, only fit him for
the trade of a housebreaker.  Better would it be for
him if he read his prayers; for as the divine Blair
sayeth, "every prayer sent up from a secret
retirement is listened to."  See, here is money, dear
Minnie,' continued the wily Snaggs, holding before
her a handful of bank-notes; 'those wretched pieces
of paper which cause so much misery and crime, will
be yours if&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'If&mdash;what?'
</p>

<p>
The tempter whispered in her ear, and his eyes
gleamed in the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
She uttered a half-stifled scream.
</p>

<p>
'For Heaven's sake let me go, Mr. Snaggs, or I
shall scream for help,' said Minnie, as a rosy crimson
replaced the paleness of her cheek.
</p>

<p>
'None can hear you.'
</p>

<p>
'Be not so sure of that,' she retorted, with a
scornful smile.
</p>

<p>
'Remember your uncle, his sick wife and family!
Why are you so afraid?' he whispered; 'I will be
your protector for life, Minnie, and will open up a
thousand new scenes and pleasures to you.  Let me
teach you that you were not born to live always in
this dull and hideous glen.  Oh, Minnie, have my
eyes not told you the secret of my heart?'
</p>

<p>
'I am getting quite faint,' said Minnie, overcome
by excitement and alarm.
</p>

<p>
'Apply my handkerchief to your nostrils&mdash;this
strange perfume may revive you.'
</p>

<p>
He placed his voluminous silk handkerchief close
to her face.  In a moment a tremor passed over the
form of Minnie, and she sank senseless on the grassy
mound of the Clach-na-greiné.  With a triumphant
chuckle the pious moralist knelt down and threw
his arms around her; but in the next moment a
fierce shout rang in his startled ears, and the strong
hand of Callum Dhu was on his throat, while the
blade of a bare skene glittered before his eyes.
</p>

<p>
For a moment these two men glared at each other
like a snake and a tiger.  In the next, the frail
moralist was dashed upon the turf, and the iron
fingers of Callum compressed his throat like a vice,
until his eyeballs were starting from their sockets.
</p>

<p>
'Mac Innon,' cried my fosterer, 'what shall I
do with him? we are near the old Hill of Justice&mdash;his
life in your hands&mdash;say but the word, and the
last breath is in the nostrils of our tormentor!'
</p>

<p>
'Let us drag him to prison,' said I.
</p>

<p>
'Prison&mdash;ha&mdash;but there is none nearer than the
Castle of Inverness.'
</p>

<p>
'Then let us fling him into the Poul-a-baidh,
where the bones of many a better man are whitening
among the weeds.'
</p>

<p>
'Right&mdash;mona mon dioul! but few stones will be
on your cairn, dog!'
</p>

<p>
And snatching by the throat and heels the terrified
wretch, who could scarcely gasp for mercy, we
rushed to the edge of the pool, where justice was
executed of old, and flung him headlong in.
</p>

<p>
'The curse of the Red Priest be on him!' cried
Callum, as Snaggs disappeared with a scream of
terror.  Anon, he rose to the surface, floundering,
dashing, and bellowing for aid, until he laid hold of
the long weeds and broad-bladed water-docks, that
fringed the margin, and after being nearly suffocated
by the floating watercresses (of which, I suppose, he
would in future share the horror of the learned
Scaliger), he scrambled out in a woful plight, and
ran towards his pony, which was cropping the
scanty herbage that grew among the blasted pines.
The moment he was mounted, he turned towards us
a face that was ghastly and white with fear and
fury; he was minus a hat, and his grizzled hair hung
lank and dripping about his ears.
</p>

<p>
'Scoundrels!' he cried, 'for this outrage you
shall both rot in the Castle of Inverness.'
</p>

<p>
'I will not be the only one of my race who has
been within its towers,' said I; 'but they suffered
for fighting brave battles on the mountain side&mdash;not
for ducking a yelping hound like you.'
</p>

<p>
In token of vengeance, he shook his clenched hand
at us, and galloped away.  Long before this, the
situation of Minnie attracted all our attention, and
excited our wonder and alarm.
</p>

<p>
'Laoighe mo chri&mdash;speak to me&mdash;hear me!' implored
Callum, kneeling beside her on the grass and
taking her tenderly in his arms.  But she remained
quite insensible and unconscious of all he said to
her.
</p>

<p>
'By what witchcraft did she faint thus?' said
Callum&mdash;'she, a strong and healthy girl&mdash;so full of
life and spirit too!'
</p>

<p>
'Snaggs spoke of a perfume in his handkerchief.'
</p>

<p>
'A perfume,' responded the black-browed Celt,
grinding his teeth; 'what could it be?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh&mdash;this phial may tell,' said I, picking up a
little bottle which lay on the turf beside Minnie.  It
was labelled 'Chloroform.'
</p>

<p>
'Dioul! what is that?' asked Callum.
</p>

<p>
'An essence invented by a Lowland physician.
It makes even the strongest man so insensible for a
time, that you might cut off his leg and draw all his
teeth without having the slightest resistance offered.'
</p>

<p>
'Insensible!'
</p>

<p>
'Ay, as a stone; look at our poor Minnie.'
</p>

<p>
'The unhanged villain!' exclaimed Callum, swelling
with new wrath; 'dioul! why did I not gash
his throat with my skene as I would have scored a
stag?  He had some dark and sinister end in view;
he deemed Minnie but a poor, ignorant, and
unprotected Highland girl, who knew no language but
her native Gaelic, and had no idea of aught beyond
the sides of the glen; but as far as grass grows and
wind blows will I follow and have vengeance on
him!'
</p>

<p>
Minnie recovered slowly and with difficulty: she
was sick and had an overwhelming headache, with
such a weakness in all her limbs, that we were
compelled to support, and almost carry her between
us to Glen Ora.  Callum mingled his endearments
with muttered threats of vengeance on Snaggs, and
as I knew that he would keep them too, I was not
without anxiety as to the mode in which his wrath
might develop itself.
</p>

<p>
Two days after this affair, on the application of
Mr. Snaggs, the sheriff of the county granted warrants
of removal against every family in the glen; and
these long-dreaded notices of eviction were duly
served in form of law by a messenger-at-arms, in the
name of 'Fungus Mac Fee, Esquire, Advocate and
Sheriff,' a position that worthy had gained, after the
usual lapse of time spent in sweeping the Scottish
Parliament House with the tail of his gown.
</p>

<p>
Six days now would seal our doom!
</p>

<p>
Such was the result of poor Minnie's intercession
for her old uncle, with the admirer of the 'divine
Blair.'
</p>

<p><a id="chap11"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
MY MOTHER.
</h3>

<p>
My mother was now so frail, weakened by long
illness and by being almost constantly confined to
bed, that I dared not communicate to her the fatal
'notice,' which had been served on us, in common
with all the people in the glen; but I never hoped
that she would remain long ignorant of the ruin that
hovered over all, while the garrulous old Mhari was
daily about her sick-bed.
</p>

<p>
The moanings and mutterings of that aged crone,
together with her occasional remarks whispered in
Gaelic, of course to Minnie, soon acquainted the
poor patient that every door in the glen, including
her own, had been chalked with a mark of terrible
significance; and that the crushed remnant of a
brave old race which had dwelt by the Ora for
ages&mdash;yea, before the Roman eagles cowered upon the
Scottish frontier&mdash;was at last to be swept away.
</p>

<p>
It gave her a dreadful shock&mdash;our fate she knew
was fixed: and while Mhari, Minnie, and the older
people of the glen, croaked incessantly among
themselves of the old legend of the Red Priest and 'the
curse he had laid on the stones of the jointure-house,'
my mind was a chaos; for I knew not on
what hand to turn, or where to seek a shelter for my
mother's head.  She had her little pension as a
captain's widow&mdash;true; but we had so many
dependants who clung to us in the good old Celtic
fashion, and for whom our little farm had furnished
subsistence, that to be driven from it was to tear
asunder a hundred tender and long-cherished ties,
which few but a Highlander can comprehend.
</p>

<p>
A little hope was kindled in my breast, by my
foster-brother reminding me of that which (in the
hurry of other thoughts I had forgotten)&mdash;the great
annual gathering on the Braes of Loch Ora being
now almost at hand; and that he or I&mdash;it mattered
not which&mdash;might win one of the handsome prizes
which the generosity of Cluny Mac Pherson, the
Laird of Invercauld, and other true Highland
gentlemen, offered to the men of the mountains on such
occasions, to foster their ancient spirit, to develop
their hardihood, and excite their emulation in feats
of strength and skill.
</p>

<p>
'Mother,' I whispered, and stooped over her bed,
'the gathering takes place in three days&mdash;the
daughter of the Englishman&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Sir Horace&mdash;well,' she muttered with a sigh of
anger.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, dear mother&mdash;Laura Everingham and her
friend, Miss Clavering, have made up a purse of
guineas (some say fifty, others a hundred) with a
silver brooch, for the best rifle-shot, and Callum and
I have sworn to win it if we can.'
</p>

<p>
'How many better marksmen than either of you
have, ere this, sworn the same thing?'
</p>

<p>
'But God will aid me, mother.  I will shoot
neither with pride nor with a desire to emulate any
one; but to find bread for our starving household&mdash;to
satisfy the cravings of the villain Snaggs, and to keep
this roof a little&mdash;a very little&mdash;longer over your head.'
</p>

<p>
'And this prize you say&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Will, at least, be fifty guineas, mother&mdash;think of
that.'
</p>

<p>
'Scorn alike the prize and the donor.'
</p>

<p>
'The prize I may&mdash;but the donor&mdash;ah, mother,
you know her not; but think of this money and all
it may do, if fairly and honestly won; how long is
it since we saw fifty guineas at once, mother?  It
will pay part of our arrears, and win us a little time,
if it cannot win us mercy from Snaggs and his
master.'
</p>

<p>
I dared not add that I had also in my breast a
desire to appear to advantage before the winning
daughter of Sir Horace, and the lingering hope of
eclipsing the holiday Captain Clavering and that
mustachioed popinjay Mr. Snobleigh, who had been
rifle-practising incessantly to gain the ladies' prize.
Yielding to the pressure of our affairs, and, perhaps,
to her inability to argue the point with me, my
mother gave her reluctant consent that I <i>might compete</i>.
</p>

<p>
She was very weak and faint, and before I left her,
beckoned me to kiss her cheek.  Then she burst
into tears, and this sorely startled me&mdash;for it was
long since I had seen her weep.  Her great lassitude
required composure, and more than all, it required
many comforts, which, in that sequestered district,
and with straitened means, she was compelled to
relinquish: thus, when I addressed her now, a
time always elapsed before she could collect her
scattered energies to understand or reply to me.
This prostration of a spirit once so proud, so fiery
and energetic&mdash;this emaciation of a form once so
stately and so beautiful, with those gentle hands
now so tremulous&mdash;those kind eyes now so sad and
sunken, and those weak, querulous whisperings of
affection, with the pallor of that beloved face,
smote heavily on my heart, which was traversed by
more than one sharp pang, as the terrible conviction
came upon me, that she could not be long with us
now.  Yet Mhari, Minnie, and Callum Dhu, all
strong in the belief of the legend of the Red Priest
of Applecross, believed that she was perfectly safe
while enclosed by the four charmed walls of the old
jointure-house.
</p>

<p>
'The lamp may flicker,' said Mhari, with a solemn
shake of her old grey head; 'but, please God, it can
never go out while we keep it here.'
</p>

<p>
Accompanied by Alisdair Mac Gouran, Ian Mac
Raonuil, Gillespie Ruadh, the three patriarchs of the
glen, and all the other male inhabitants, among
whom were five-and-twenty sturdy fellows, a few
being clad in tartan, but by far the greater number
wearing the coarse dark-blue homespun coats,
ungainly trousers, and broad bonnets of the peasantry,
with four pipers in front (in the Highlands everything
partakes of the warlike), we marched from
Glen Ora, and crossing the shoulder of the great
Ben, descended towards the Braes, where the gathering
was to be held, about ten miles distant.  Callum
carried my rifle as well as his own, and his
confidence that we would win Laura Everingham's
prize was somewhat amusing; but it arose less from
his certainty of our skill than from the fact of our
bullets being cast in a famous mould or <i>calme</i>, of
unknown metal, which had belonged to the father
of old Mhari, who was never known to miss his aim.
In short, it was universally believed in the glen
to be enchanted.  All the glensmen had in their
bonnets a tuft of heather and the badge of Mac
Innon, a twig of the mountain pine; and most of
them wore the clan tartan plaid, which is of bright
red striped with green.  We brought with us our
own provisions, cheese, bannocks, and whisky, which
last never paid duty to Her Majesty, as the reader
may be assured.
</p>

<p>
Though my suit of tartans was far from rich or
handsome&mdash;nay, I might almost say that it was very
plain&mdash;it was correct, and with three feathers of the
iolair in my bonnet, and my father's old 42nd's
claymore, having <i>Biodh treun</i>&mdash;be valiant&mdash;inscribed on
its blade, my pistols, horn, skene-dhu and biodag, I
marched over the crest of the hill which shaded our
Highland glen with as much pride in my heart as if
all the well-armed Mac Innons that over followed my
fathers of old were behind me; for this native pride,
and a glow of old romance, as a poor Highland
gentleman, were all that remained to me now.
</p>

<p>
The summer morning was bright and beautiful; the
air was fresh and keen, and we drank it in at every
pore; the unclouded sun was in all his brilliance;
the pipes rang loud and clear; and Callum, with
three or four others, sang one of the warlike songs of
Ian Lom.  The gallant coileach-dhu (or black cock)
rose before us at times; the useag sang merrily
among the black whin-bushes, and the mountain-bee
and the butterfly skimmed over the purple heatherbells.
My heart grew light; I forgot for a time that
my mother was sick and dying&mdash;that ruin hovered
over us; and, boylike, I thought only of the sports of
the day, and the glory of our people carrying off the
prizes on the same green braes where Lachlan Mohr
had routed Clan Dhiarmid an Tuirc in the days of the
great Cavalier.
</p>

<p>
The spirit of those who accompanied me rose also.
Even Ephraim Snaggs, his notices of eviction, and
his legal terrors, were forgotten.  The veteran Mac
Raonuil marched with his head up and his war-medal
glittering, as he told old yarns of the brave Black
Watch, and Callum urged that we, this day, should
give place to none; but remember, that the Mac
Innons were the <i>head</i> of the five tribes&mdash;the Mac
Gregors, Grants, Mac Nabs and Mac Alpines, who
have ever been linked together in Celtic tradition, as
the descendants of five royal brothers, and are hence
known as the Siòl Alpin.  The Highlander broods
over these old memories, and treasures them up as
his only inheritance, and they are his best and
highest incentive to noble daring in the hour of
battle, and to kindly emotions of clanship in the day
of peace.
</p>

<p>
'Blessed,' says Andrew Picken, 'be that spirit of
nationality or clanship, or by whatever name the
principle may be called, which opens up the heart of
man to his brother man; and in spite of the trained
selfishness to which he is educated in artificial life,
bids the warm and glorious feeling of sympathy gush
forth in circumstances of sorrow and of trouble, to
cheer the drooping heart of the unfortunate, and
prevent his swearing hatred to his own species.'[*]

CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
THE GATHERING.
</h3>

<p>
The day was clear and beautiful; the unclouded sun,
I have said, shone in all his splendour through a
summer sky.  The vast amphitheatre of hills which
surround the braes of Loch Ora were mellowed in
the sunny haze, or the silver vapour exhaled from the
little pools of water that dotted all the heath-clad
plain.  At the base of Ben Ora, which towered above
the braes, the monarch of all the adjacent mountains,
the gathering took place.  The lower part of the hill
was dotted by a line of snow-white tents and marquees,
over which waved various flags and streamers.
Amid these tents were a number of carriages; but
the horses had been untraced, unbitted, and were
quietly cropping the herbage, or enjoying their feeds
of corn in the background.  A great oval space was
formed by the spectators who had crowded hither
from all quarters to witness the games; the tall ruins
of an ancient tower, once the stronghold of the
Thanes of Loch Ora, enclosed one end of this oval;
the waters of the dark-blue loch, rolling up to the
base of the mighty mountain, enclosed the other; and
here the red-funnelled steamers from Glasgow, Oban,
and Inverness, were disgorging their passengers in
hundreds at every trip.  The slope of Ben Ora
resembled a parterre of flowers, so varied were the
dresses of the ladies.  Fringed parasols of the most
brilliant colours were fluttering on the soft wind;
and the blue sunshades and broad bloomer-hats of the
fairer portion of the assembly, mingled with the
wide-awakes, Glengarry bonnets, and those peculiar
tartan caps or crush-hats, which, with the checked
coat and 'fast' waistcoat, generally indicate
Messrs. Brown, Jones, and Robinson&mdash;the thorough Cockney
when touring in the Highlands.  Appetized by the
long ride, drive, or march to the Braes, or by the
morning's sail up the sunlit loch, already the
merrymakers had begun to uncork their bottles and unpack
their hampers, amid a fund of laughter, frolics, and
nonsense; and white cloths were spread on the grass,
on the roofs of carriages, or any other available
place; while champagne cooled in the mountain
stream, and pale Bass, Guinness XX Dublin stout,
<i>uiskey</i>, cold grouse, veal and venison pies, tongue,
fowl, milk-punch, ices, hock, and seltzer-water, with
all other accessories for pic-nicking were in
requisition.  In other places were knots or groups of
Highlanders, talking in guttural Gaelic, laughing or
croaking over their ills, or drinking toasts&mdash;'up with horn,
and down with corn'&mdash;'the mountains and valleys,'
&amp;c., while troops of children, bare-headed and
bare-legged, swarmed and gambolled about them, filling
the air with shrill and strange cries of delight.
</p>

<p>
Among the <i>élite</i> of the company was a stately
duchess, whose family have long been notorious in
the annals of cruelty and eviction; and whose glens
have been swept of thousands of brave men, after the
artifices of an infamous factor, the oppression of the
game-laws, the destruction of the kelp manufacture,
the slaughter of the flower of the clans in the
Peninsular war, and other Highland evils, had driven the
people to starvation and despair!  There were present
also a couple of chattering countesses, and many old
ladies, whose pedigrees were considerably longer
than their purses; but who, nevertheless, deemed
themselves the prime patronesses of the gathering,
as they usually were of the Northern Meeting.
Flounced, feathered, and jewelled, with clan tartan
scarfs, they regarded with just and due condescension
the crowds of richly-dressed and handsome South-country
women, many of whom were attired <i>à outrance</i>,
complete in elegance and fashion from bonnet and
bracelet to their kid shoes.  These, our decayed
Highland tabbies regarded with the good-nature
which generally falls to the lot of such wallflowers,
who may, as Swift has it&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Convey a libel in a frown,<br />
  Or wink a reputation down;<br />
  Or by the tossing of a fan,<br />
  Describe the lady and the man."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Among the <i>élite</i> of the male sex were various
holiday warriors attired in gorgeous clan tartans.
Some were distinguished by one eagle's feather in the
bonnet, marking the gentleman; others by two,
indicating the chieftain; but very few by <i>three</i>, the badge
of a <i>chief</i>.  The principal of the latter, was the Most
Noble the Marquis of Drumalbane, Admiral of the
Western Isles and Western Coast of Scotland&mdash;one
whose forefathers had led their thousands to the
field, and from whose glens our most splendid
Highland regiments had marched to many a torrid clime
and bloody victory; but whose vast territories were
now a deathlike waste, where nothing was heard but
the bleat of the sheep and the whistle of the curlew.
In Glenarchai alone, this enterprising exterminator
had converted thirty thousand acres into a hunting-forest.
He was attended&mdash;<i>not</i> by a thousand brave
men in arms&mdash;but by a few puny footmen and
Lowland gamekeepers attired as Highlanders, and a few
gentlemen who wore in their bonnets the eagle's
wing, and carried at their necks each a silver key, as
captains of certain ruined fortresses among the
mountains of the West Highlands.
</p>

<p>
The varied tartans and magnificent appointments
of these holiday Highlanders had a barbaric and
picturesque effect.  Their belts and buckles, jewelled
daggers and pistols, snow-white sporrans, tasselled
with silver or gold, their brooches studded by Scottish
topazes and amethysts, and all their paraphernalia of
mountain chivalry, flashed and sparkled in the
noonday sun; while long bright ribbons and little
banneroles of every colour streamed from the ebony
drones of more than a hundred war-pipes.
</p>

<p>
Beside these gay duinewassals, the poor men of
Glen Ora seemed but a troop of reapers or fishermen;
but we stepped not the less proudly, because to the
same march with which our pipers woke the echoes
of the hills, our fathers had thrice left Glentuirc to
sweep the Campbells of Breadalbane from Rannoch
and Lochaber to the gates of Kilchurn.
</p>

<p>
In this epoch of civilization and ridicule, when
even patriotism, religion, and love are made a jest,
the reader may smile at these references to a past,
and what we <i>conventionally</i> deem a barbarous age;
but a mountaineer never forgets that the brave
traditions of other times are ever his best incentive to
heroic enterprise and purity of thought.
</p>

<p>
In the centre of the vast oval formed by the spectators,
tents, and carriages, lay the sledge-hammers,
the uprooted cabers, the putting-stones, cannon-balls,
broad-swords, targets, and other appurtenances of the
games.
</p>

<p>
On halting and dispersing my followers, my first
impulse was to scan the crowd for Miss Everingham,
now that I could appear before her in my proper
character, and to better advantage than I had hitherto
done; and just as the sports were beginning, I saw
the baronet's four-in-hand drag, the team of which,
the showy Captain Clavering handled in first-rate
style, come sweeping round the base of the hill, with
its varnished wheels and embossed harness flashing
in the sun; the captain, whose costume was most
accurate, from his well-fitting white kid gloves to his
glazed boots, adroitly halted it in the most central
and conspicuous place.  I was standing close by where
he reined up, and then the <i>sense</i> of Laura's presence
made my heart beat violently, while my colour
came and went again.  No notice was taken of me
for some time by the party of well-dressed
fashionables who crowded the drag, till the studied
respect shown to me by the peasantry, not one of
whom passed or approached me without vailing his
bonnet, attracted the attention of Sir Horace, who
was quietly surveying the <i>canaille</i> through a
double-barrelled lorgnette.  He then gave me a formal
bow and conventional smile, but barely
condescended to notice, even by a glance, my
foster-brother Callum Dhu; but for whom (as Callum
himself said,) 'the red tarr-dhiargan had been then
perhaps nestling among his hair at the bottom of
Loch Ora.'
</p>

<p>
Near the carriage-steps stood Mr. Jeames Toodles
in all the splendour of red plush investments for his
nether-man, and spotless white stockings on his
curved but ample calves.  He bore a gold-headed
cane and an enormous bouquet, and from time to
time cast furtive glances at Callum Dhu, who, being
armed to the teeth, he deemed little better than a
cannibal or Tchernemoski Cossack.
</p>

<p>
Snobleigh&mdash;we beg pardon&mdash;Mr. Adolphus Frederick
Snobleigh&mdash;who cantered up on a dashing bay
mare, languidly gave me the tips of his fingers, with
a dreamy 'aw&mdash;how aw you&mdash;glad to see you old
fellow&mdash;any noos to-day?'  But Clavering, who had
more of the soldier about him, shook me heartily
by the hand, examined the lock and barrel of my
rifle, and praised the piece; then he turned to his
sister and Miss Everingham, both of whom greeted
me in a manner so winning and gay, that even the
heart of my mother, encrusted as it was by old
Highland prejudices, would have been won.
</p>

<p>
I still remember how my heart throbbed when
Laura's soft and velvet hand touched mine; for her
glove was off, and then the little white fingers on
which the diamonds were flashing, rested on the
window of the carriage.
</p>

<p>
'And <i>you</i> mean to shoot for my prize to-day!'
said she, while her sunny eyes danced with youth
and pleasure; 'how kind of you to honour us so
far as to compete for the purse which Fanny and I
have made up.  We hope you will prove victorious&mdash;indeed,
we are quite certain that you will, Mr. Mac Innon.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Mr.</i> to the head of the Siol Alpine!' growled
Callum, under his thick black beard.
</p>

<p>
I pardoned her that prefix, which always jars on a
Celtic ear, for her good wishes were so warmly and
so prettily expressed.
</p>

<p>
Alas! how little she knew the agony that was
gnawing my heart, under an exterior so calm.  How
little could she conceive the breathless eagerness
with which Callum and I longed to win this wretched
prize&mdash;an eagerness fired by no spirit of rivalry;
but by an honest desire to keep a crumbling roof
above the head of my dying mother&mdash;for a very
little longer.  And away over the dun mountains,
far from this gay scene of mirth and sunshine, my
heart wandered to that little darkened room where
she was lying in a half-torpid state, with pretty
Minnie reading or knitting beside her, and old
Mhari creeping and creaking about her bed on tiptoe.
</p>

<p>
Laura Everingham knew nothing of all this, and
she looked so pretty in her white crape bonnet, with
her sunny English smile, her blooming cheek reddened
by our healthy Scottish breeze, that I deemed
her all the happier in her ignorance of the misery
her presence&mdash;or, at least, the presence and the
projects of her father, were about to work among
the old race of Glen Ora.  Young, ardent, and
enthusiastic, could I fail to be flattered by her notice,
pleased by the preference which her good wishes
inferred, and dazzled by her beauty?&mdash;for I will
uphold that her mere prettiness became absolute
<i>beauty</i>, when one knew more of Laura, and
learned to appreciate her goodness and worth.
</p>

<p>
'When will the games begin, Fanny?  I am so
impatient,' said Laura; 'look at that love of a
horse&mdash;he eats corn from the groom's hand; and see,
Clavering, such a pet of a bonnet on that old thing's
head.  Who is she&mdash;does anybody know?  Of course
they will, for every one in the Highlands knows
every one else.  But who would expect to find such
bonnets in Scotland?  Who is that handsome fellow
in the green uniform, with the enormous gold
epaulettes&mdash;a Russian officer?'
</p>

<p>
'No,' answered Fanny, with a droll smile, 'he is
only an archer of the Queen's Scotch body-guard,
who is to shoot for a prize to-day.  From the care
with which his whiskers are curled, I will take heavy
odds that <i>he</i> don't win.'
</p>

<p>
'And that tall handsome fellow with the black
beard&mdash;oh such a love of a beard it is!  Heavens, it
is the man who saved my dear papa's life!'
</p>

<p>
'He is my foster-brother, Miss Everingham; he,
too, means to compete for your prize.'
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;the fellow seems so strong that he might
squeeze the wataw out of a whinstone; and aw&mdash;aw,
as for tossing that fwightful cabaw&mdash;goodness
gwacious!' yawned the languid A. F. Snobleigh,
surveying the six feet and odd inches of Callum through
his eyeglass.
</p>

<p>
'He is quite a model of a man, Laura,' said Fanny
Clavering; 'I would marry him in a moment if he
would have me.  He looks so like&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What we read of in romances.'
</p>

<p>
'A bandit&mdash;a wild mountain robber&mdash;and I have
always thought it would be so exciting, so delightful
to marry a real robber, and be the bride of a real
bandit or corsair&mdash;oh, I should love a corsair of all
things, especially if his bark were a fine steam yacht,
we should have such delightful pic-nics among the
Greek Isles, and trips to the garrison balls at Corfu!'
</p>

<p>
'You perceive, Miss Everingham,' said Captain
Clavering, laughing, while he smoothed his
unparalleled white kid gloves, 'our noisy Fanny has a
strong love for the charms of nature in an unsophisticated
state.  Hence her rapture at the long whiskers
and bare legs of these Highlandmen.'
</p>

<p>
The cold, artificial, and aristocratic Sir Horace,
whom the gold of his father, who died a wealthy
Manchester millionaire and docile ministerialist, had
made a baronet and king of our Highland glen,
received all who approached his carriage with the same
bow, the same smile, the same welcome, and nearly
the same set of stereotyped phrases, good wishes and
warm inquiries; and thus he graciously received his
facile and obnoxious factor and factotum, Mr. Snaggs,
who had been delayed by the ceremony of founding
a new dissenting chapel, and who now galloped up
on his barrel-bellied and knock-kneed pony, which
he rode with a huge crupper and creaking saddle.  A
dark, almost savage scowl flitted for a moment across
the usually placid and affectedly benign visage of
'the moralist,' and admirer of Blair, as our piper
Ewen Oig passed and repassed him, playing the
march of Black Donald; and then he smiled with
malicious triumph, as if anticipating that day now
so near at hand, when the war-pipe of Mac Innon
would be hushed for ever by the shores of the Western
Sea.
</p>

<p>
I exchanged a glance full of deep and bitter
import, with the calm, stern, and stately Callum Dhu;
then we withdrew a little way, for the vicinity of
this man's presence was hateful to us, and now, amid
a buzz of tongues began the great business of the
gathering&mdash;a gathering summoned to foster the
nationality of a people, whom the grasping aristocracy
are leaving nothing undone to exterminate and
destroy.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
THE STONE OF STRENGTH.
</h3>

<p>
Having many of my own adventures to relate, I will
confine my narrative chiefly to the achievements of
those in whom I am most interested&mdash;the men of
Glen Ora; and even in that I must be brief.  In all
those athletic sports, which in time of peace were of
old, and are still the principal amusements of the
Gael, there were many stout and hardy competitors;
but Callum's known fame for strength and agility,
together with his cool and confident air and graceful
bearing, made them all dubious of victory, yet there
were on the ground the flower of that poor remnant,
who now represent the once powerful clans of the
West.
</p>

<p>
Young Ewen Oig, the most handsome lad in our
glen, elicited a burst of applause, and won the first
prize for the sword dance, a species of Pyrrhic
measure, performed over the crossed blades of two
claymores; and he was also the victor of the dangerous
Geal-ruith or race up hill, when nearly twenty strong
and active Celts, hardy and swift as mountain deer,
flung their belts, bonnets, and plaids on the ground,
and with their kilts girdled tightly about them,
started in a line at full speed up the steep slope of
the Craig-na-tuirc, for the goal, a rough misshapen
block that marked the scene of some forgotten conflict.
</p>

<p>
In the broadsword and target exercise the old men
bore away the palm, for these warlike accomplishments
are disused by the young; but, for the dangerous
feat of swinging the sledge-hammer and
tossing a long iron bar fairly over-end-long, by one
turn of the foot, the silver medals were bestowed on
Gillespie Ruadh; while the victor of the Clach-neart,
or <i>stone of strength</i>,&mdash;one of which in the days of old
usually lay at the door of every chief, that he might
test the muscle of his followers, was Callum Dhu,
who flung it a full yard and more, beyond the most
powerful champions of the adjacent glens and clans.
</p>

<p>
Then came the play with the Clach-cuid-fir, a more
serious test of strength.
</p>

<p>
In the centre of that great arena, formed by the
circle of wondering and excited spectators, lay two
stones, one of which was a square block about four
feet high; the other was smaller and weighed two
hundred and fifty pounds in weight.  This was the
<i>clach</i>.  In the Highlands, he who could lift the lesser
and place it on the larger block was esteemed <i>a man</i>,
and entitled from thenceforward to wear a bonnet.
Though much disused in general, this severe Celtic
feat had still been remembered and practised by the
men who dwelt in our remote districts; but as most of
those who came with me were youths whose energies
were scarcely developed, or old men whose strength
was beginning to fail, Callum Dhu alone advanced to
the clach-cuid-fir, and, taking off his bonnet, bowed
to the people, in token that he challenged all men
present to the essay.
</p>

<p>
His air, his garb, his bare muscular limbs, his
stately port, erected head and ample chest, gave him
the aspect of one of the athletæ of the Roman games.
Thrice he waved his bonnet in token of challenge to
the people, and though a murmur of admiration
greeted him, there was no other response.  At his
neck hung a brass miraculous medal and little
crucifix, for Callum had been reared a Catholic, and
these he carefully adjusted before he began.  Every
eye and opera-glass were fixed upon him, while
grasping the ponderous clach, and with a simple, but
scarcely perceptible effort, he raised and placed it
gently on the summit of the greater block.
</p>

<p>
For a moment the people paused as if they had
each and all held in their breath, and then a loud,
long and hearty plaudit made the sunny welkin ring:
and my breast expanded with honest pride in Callum's
strength and prowess.
</p>

<p>
'Heavens&mdash;such a love of a man!' exclaimed
Fanny Clavering, with astonishment and delight
sparkling in her beautiful eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Regulaw brick&mdash;aw!' added her cavalier, Mr. Snobleigh,
whose glass was wedged in his right eye.
</p>

<p>
'Egad!' exclaimed Captain Clavering, with honest
English warmth and admiration; 'this is the mettle
of which the Scots make their Highland regiments.'
</p>

<p>
'Such were our men, sir,' said I, bowing; 'but
there are few now between Lochness and Lochaber,
who could perform a feat like this.'
</p>

<p>
'The greater is the cause of regret.'
</p>

<p>
'Now, Callum,' said I, 'let us have no more of
this.  You have tasked your strength enough for one
day&mdash;and remember you have long been weak and
ailing.'
</p>

<p>
'I have been struggling to give pride and pleasure
to Minnie, and if I conquer, 'tis as much for her sake
as for yours, Mac Innon.  She pinned this cockade on
my bonnet when I left her, and reminding me of the
former prizes I had won, smiled on me, as she alone
can smile; for Minnie is the fairest flower on the
banks of the Ora.  But what seeks this red-legged
partridge here?' he continued, in Gaelic.
</p>

<p>
This was applied to the valet of Sir Horace,
Mr. Jeames Toodles, who, notwithstanding the splendour
of his livery, his red plush nether habiliments, laced
hat and heraldic buttons, approached timidly to say,
that 'Sir 'Orace vished that ere thingumbob lifted
again, if the gentlemen had no objections.'
</p>

<p>
Callum gave the liveryman a withering glance, and
touching his bonnet to the ladies, pushed the clach off
the lower block with one hand.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, papa,' exclaimed Miss Everingham, 'how can
you be so cruel as to ask this?  Don't you see that
the poor man looks quite faint, after all he has done
already?'
</p>

<p>
'Never mind,' said the baronet, from his well-stuffed
carriage; 'up with it again, my man, and here
is a sovereign for you!'
</p>

<p>
While something like an emotion of rage and
humiliation made the eyes of my fosterer flash fire, he
snatched up the ponderous clach, and after poising it
aloft for a moment, while he trembled in every limb,
while every muscle and fibre strained and stood like
cords and wires of iron, and while the perspiration
oozed from every opening pore, he dashed it down upon
the lower block, and shivered it into fifty fragments.
</p>

<p>
I saw that he was deathly pale, when Mr. Jeames
Toodles approached him with the sovereign, but
whether in anger, or that his strength had been
wantonly overtasked, I know not&mdash;probably both.
Disdaining to touch the coin, the poor half-starved
fox-hunter said to the valet, with a glance of quiet
contempt&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Put that in your pocket, my friend, and thank
your master for me.  Dioul!' he added, in Gaelic,
'does this man think to pay us like English rope-dancers,
or the fellow who squeaks in Punch's box at
the fair?  Air Dhia! we have not yet come to that!'
</p>

<p>
'You are a noble fellow,' exclaimed Fanny Clavering,
patting his brawny shoulder with her pretty
hand, while her fine eyes sparkled; 'I shall
never&mdash;never forget you.'
</p>

<p>
'Miss Clavering,' said Sir Horace, coldly; 'you
forget yourself.'
</p>

<p>
Then came the tossing of the caber&mdash;a tree which
is cut short off by the roots, and must be balanced by
a man in the palms of his hands, and which he must
toss completely round in the air, so that it may fall
endlong in a direct line from him.  In this feat, none
ever excelled a little tribe named the Mac Ellars, who
for more than a thousand years had resided in Glen-tuirc;
but about twelve months before this time, they
had been expelled with great cruelty by Snaggs.
Their huts were burned down, and several persons
who were old and bedridden, were wounded&mdash;three
mortally&mdash;by the soldiers from Fort Augustus.  These
had been ordered to fire through the thatched roofs
to force the people out, after which the whole were
driven at the bayonet's point to the sea-shore, where
they were ironed and embarked on board the famous
evicting ship, the <i>Duchess</i>, which awaited them at Isle
Ornsay, to convey the whole tribe to the nearest port
of the American coast; so, when the caber was carried
to-day, the strong hands that were wont to toss it
high aloft, amid the honest shouts that woke the
rocky echoes of Ben Ora, were now assisting to clear
the vast forests of that Far West, where the sun of the
clans is sinking.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV
<br /><br />
THE SEVEN BULLETS.
</h3>

<p>
Now came the rifle-shooting, which deserves an entire
chapter to itself.  The first prize was no less than a
hundred sovereigns; the second was fifty.
</p>

<p>
Laura Everingham and Fanny Clavering had
constituted themselves the patronesses of this feat of
skill; but though the purses, on the acquisition of
which the whole energies of Callum and myself were
devoted&mdash;in no spirit of vain-glory, as I have said,
but goaded on by the spur of sheer adversity&mdash;was
made up by them and their female friends; yet
Fanny by her air and bearing, her energy, in short
by the very noise she made, assumed the supreme
direction of affairs; thus the gentler Laura, in her
little white crape bonnet and lace shawl, seemed a
mere appendage to her beautiful, brilliant, and 'Di
Vernon' looking friend.
</p>

<p>
Fanny was a free and dashing girl, with whom <i>you</i>
must have fallen in love, my bachelor friend, for she
was one who made herself everywhere as much at
home as the fly in your sugar-basin.  She wore a
broad hat and feather, which gave a piquancy to her
fine eyes and expressive features.  She had on a dark
green riding-habit, with yellow gauntlets, and carried
a gold-headed switch.  She was a showy girl&mdash;the
pet of the Household Brigade, and the counterpart of
her brother the Guardsman, only a little more merry,
and much more wilful.  She was a good horsewoman,
and rode hurdle-races and steeple-chases; a good hand
at whist, rather a sharp stroke at billiards, and would
deliberately sweep up the pool with the prettiest
white hands in the world.  She waltzed divinely,
was considered glorious in a two-handed flirtation, or
private theatricals, where she shone to admiration as
'Di Vernon,' or the 'Rough Diamond.'  Fanny could
make up a good book on the Oaks, and had always a
shrewd guess as to the winner of the Derby; she had
the Army List and the Peerage at her taper finger-ends,
and knew all the last novels and music as if
they had been her own composition.  Once upon a
time she was nearly riding herself for the Chester
Cup; and those who peddled and punted at mere
county races, she despised as heartily as if she
belonged to the Hussars or the Oxford Blues.  In short,
Fanny knew everything from the Deluge to the deux-temps,
and from the misfortunes in the Crimea to the
mystery of crochet&mdash;moreover, a word in your ear,
my dear reader, our charming friend had some
thousand pounds per annum in her own right, and
'expectations' without end.
</p>

<p>
She had urged the more timid and retiring Laura
to club their prize for the rifle-shooting; and now she
appeared on the ground with a smart grooved rifle in
her hands, to compete with all comers, on the part of
herself and of the shrinking Laura, who had never
laid her little hand upon a fire-arm in her life, and
begged to be excused doing so now.
</p>

<p>
About thirty Highlanders, armed with rifles,
crowded near her, but respectfully waited until
Mr. Snaggs, whom she had requested to assist her, called
over their names as they stood on the list, and to
each as he stepped forward, the factor somewhat
ostentatiously handed a&mdash;religious tract.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Captain Clavering, Mr. Snobleigh (who
wore a green sporting-coat with bronze buttons, on
each of which was a fox's head), Callum Dhu, Ewen
Oig, a few more privileged persons, and I, remained
by her side, and now all the spectators pressed
forward with interest to witness the shooting.
</p>

<p>
Callum and I were wont to shoot deer running, at
four hundred yards, and to pierce a potato when
tossed into the air, using spherical rifle-balls; thus
we had little doubt of our success; but we meant to
challenge the holiday huntsmen of the Lowlands to a
trial of skill they little thought of.
</p>

<p>
The shooting proceeded with great spirit and
rapidity, and it was admirable, for all the competitors
were expert sportsmen.  The targets were of iron,
placed against the wall of the ruined tower, in a place
which was sheltered from the wind, and afforded a
long and level range.  We shot at five hundred
yards, and though the average was six balls out of
twelve, put into a six-foot target, Callum, whose
hands shook after tossing the caber, struck the nail on
the head at two hundred yards; and Ewen Oig, I, and
other Highlanders, easily put each, eight consecutive
sphero-conical balls into the target, at an average of
four inches from the bull's-eye; and at one hundred
and eighty yards broke every quart-bottle that was
placed before us.
</p>

<p>
There was a deliberation in the air of Callum Dhu
that confounded the competitors.  After squibbing his
rifle, he carefully measured the charge of powder,
poured it slowly down the barrel which he held
straight and upright; then he moistened the wadding,
poised the bullet thereon, setting it fairly in with his
forefinger and thumb, and then he drove it firmly
home.  Then he capped, cocked, and placing the
butt-plate square against the top-arm muscle, levelled
surely and firmly to prevent the rifle from 'kicking.'  A
moment his keen bright hazel eye glanced along
the sites, and while, impressed by these grave
preparations, all held their breath, he fired with a deadly
precision that none could surpass.
</p>

<p>
Clavering struck the bull's-eye thrice in succession
at two hundred yards: but his shooting was not to be
compared to ours; and we were greeted by bursts of
applause in which he joined loudly, for he was a fine,
frank and honest-hearted fellow.
</p>

<p>
'This beats everything I have met with, Miss
Everingham,' said he, with great delight; 'I have
seen the Cockneys shooting at Chalk Farm&mdash;the Chasseurs
at Vincennes and the Jagers at Frankfort, where
ten targets were shot as fast as the markers could
work; but these Highland marksmen beat them
hollow, and this is in a land where the game-laws say
the tenant shall not have a gun.  Old Leather-stocking,
with his boasted Killdeer, could do nothing
like this.'
</p>

<p>
'All skill and practice, my dear sir,' suggested
Mr. Snaggs, who had repeatedly been solacing himself by
quiet sneers at Highlanders in general, and myself in
particular; 'to allow tenants the use of guns would
only lead to poaching and vice, "which," sayeth the
trite Quarles, "is its own punishment."'
</p>

<p>
It was unanimously agreed that Callum and I were
the victors of that day's shooting.  Elated by the
prospect of winning the prize, and feeling happy that
I would thereby be honestly enabled to relieve, to a
certain extent, the troubles of a sick and aged parent,
after a moment's conference with Callum, I turned to
Captain Clavering, saying,
</p>

<p>
'We have shot at your targets placed at five hundred
yards, and were ready to have done so, had they
been placed at a thousand yards, if our rifles had been
furnished with telescope sights.  We will now challenge
<i>you</i> to a trial of skill, which may be new to you&mdash;with
seven solid sugar-loaf balls shot from thirty-six
inch rifled barrels.'
</p>

<p>
'Agreed,' said the Captain: 'I have shot a deer
running at nearly five hundred yards, and have no
fear.'
</p>

<p>
'Ewen Oig, bring our targets and hang one over
the battlement of the tower,' said I to the young
piper, who was the son of Gillespie Ruadh, and was
lithe, nimble, and active.  He took one of the small
white targets we had brought with us from Glen Ora,
and which measured about three feet square, and bore,
in black line upon it, the figure of a cross.  With this
he scrambled to the summit of the ruined tower, a
daring feat, as it was more than seventy feet in height,
and there he fixed it firmly by means of a hammer,
nails, and holdfasts.  We now approached within two
hundred yards, and challenged the competitors two
and two, to put <i>seven</i> bullets successively into the
lines of the cross which measured two feet one way by
one the other.
</p>

<p>
The impatient Mr. Snobleigh fired and missed.
'You keep your head too high, sir,' said Callum;
'thus, in firing, your line of vision does not follow
the line of the barrel, and yours is rather more than
thirty-six inches in length.'
</p>

<p>
Clavering fired twice, and twice splintered the
edge of the target.  All their other bullets were
flattened like lichens on the castle wall, and he and
Snobleigh drew back, muttering something about the
unusual height and range.
</p>

<p>
Fanny now came forward with her smart rifle,
which was decorated by ribbons, and which Snobleigh
had loaded for her; she, and some one else, fired
seven bullets between them, and one only struck the
lower verge of the little target.
</p>

<p>
'Now, sirs,' said she to Callum and me; 'it is your
turn'&mdash;but Callum lowered his rifle and drew back,
'What is the matter, sir?'
</p>

<p>
'I cannot contend with a lady,' said he, doffing his
bonnet, 'and more than all, with one who is among
the fairest in the land.'
</p>

<p>
'Shoot, shoot, I command you!' said Fanny, while
her dark eyes flashed with girlish triumph at Callum's
honest admiration of her great beauty.
</p>

<p>
'Your will is a law to me, madam.  My chief and
I will fire by turn&mdash;he, four balls, and I, three; and
here I must give place to him.  Had your hand been
as powerful as your eye, Miss Clavering, we had but
little chance of victory to-day.'
</p>

<p>
'I told you he was a love of a man, Laura,'
whispered Fanny to her friend, the charm of whose
presence was for ever in my mind, and I was fired by
an ambition to outshine the perfumed Snobleigh&mdash;he
who owned a park and hall in Yorkshire, a house
"in town," another in Paris; a stud at Tattersall's, a
yacht at Cowes, a shooting-box on the Grampians, and
a commission in the Foot Guards&mdash;while I&mdash;what
did I own? only my father's name, with the poor
inheritance of Highland pride, and the dreams of other
days.
</p>

<p>
'We shall see if these boasting Celts can perform
this fine feat themselves,' sneered Mr. Snaggs, as he
adjusted his spectacles and came fussily forward.
</p>

<p>
'Factor,' whispered Callum in his deep voice,
'the breast of the villain who thought to outrage my
Minnie is smaller than that target, yet my ball may
reach it some day, <i>on the lone hillside, at a thousand
yards</i>!'
</p>

<p>
Snaggs grew pale, as if the death-shot was ringing
in his ears.  As I levelled my rifle, the betting began.
I fired and placed the ball in the black line at the
very head of the cross.  Then Callum stepped forward.
</p>

<p>
'Fifty to one, he hits the black line,' said Clavering.
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;done&mdash;I take you&mdash;cool hundred if you
like,' drawled Snobleigh, betting-book in hand!
</p>

<p>
'It is done, by Jove; right through the target!'
</p>

<p>
'Lend me the telescope.'
</p>

<p>
'I could hit the medal on your breast at half the
distance, Captain Clavering,' said Callum, as he fired
again.
</p>

<p>
'Thank you, my fine fellow; I would rather you
found another mark.  Bravo! in the very centre of
the cross!' continued Clavering, who was looking at
the target through his telescope.
</p>

<p>
Then I fired again, and lodged my bullet in the
black line, a little lower down, and so we discharged
our seven bullets, planting them all fairly until the
cruciform arrangement was complete, thus&mdash;
</p>

<pre>
        *
      * * *
        *
        *
        *
</pre>

<p class="noindent">
Then Ewen Oig, wild with excitement, sprang again
to the summit of the tower, wrenched away the target,
and it was carried round the field, with the pipes
playing before it, while we, by three hearty bursts of
applause, were hailed the victors of the shooting-butts.
</p>

<p>
'By Jove,' exclaimed Clavering, 'I wish I could
do this!'
</p>

<p>
'So you might, Captain, easily, if your bullets had
been cast in the same mould.'
</p>

<p>
'How&mdash;what do you mean?'
</p>

<p>
'In the mould of old Mhari's father, the forester of
Coille-tor.'
</p>

<p>
'The deuce! you don't mean to say they are
charmed,' said the Captain, laughing;
'enchanted&mdash;bewitched?'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps they are, and perhaps they are not.  I
say nothing; but I wounded the white stag with one.'
</p>

<p>
'Ha, ha, ha! capital&mdash;I like this!' exclaimed
Clavering.
</p>

<p>
'Der Freischutz in the North&mdash;a second Hans
Rudner,' said Laura Everingham; 'but the prizes
are undoubtedly theirs.'
</p>

<p>
'By Jove, how a few such fellows would have
picked off the Russians from the rifle-pits!'
</p>

<p>
'And this victor is our quiet-looking Allan Mac
Innon,' said Laura, her eyes beaming with a pleasure
that intoxicated me.
</p>

<p>
'He is a regular trump!' added the Captain,
with manly honesty, although he had been beaten.
</p>

<p>
'He looks so calm and demure,' continued Miss
Everingham, 'no one would have thought it was&mdash;it
was&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'It was in him,' suggested Clavering, squibbing
off his rifle; 'why don't you become a soldier, Mac
Innon&mdash;there is good stuff in you&mdash;'pon my soul, I
like you immensely! don't <i>you</i>, Miss Everingham?'
</p>

<p>
At this absurd question, Laura coloured to her
temples, and grew pale again.
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;aw,' began Mr. Snobleigh, who looked
irritated and discomfited; 'I aw&mdash;nevaw saw such
shooting certainly&mdash;beats Jerningham of ours, and he
as the world knows, was matched&mdash;aw&mdash;aw&mdash;twenty-five
pigeons&mdash;aw&mdash;against you, Clavering, for fifty
sovereigns a-side; but I'll back these 'Ighland fellows
against all England&mdash;aw.'
</p>

<p>
Now came the most exciting and, to me, humiliating
part of the proceedings&mdash;the distribution of the
first and second prizes for shooting.
</p>

<p>
Though poor, crushed and bruised by biting
poverty, I could not, without an emotion of shame,
accept the hundred sovereigns from the hand of Laura
Everingham, and decline the more suitable gift of a
silver cup, which was the alternative, in the case of a
gentleman being the victorious competitor!  Now in
my inmost heart I felt that a poor and proud gentleman
was the most miserable of all God's creatures.
Clavering's words, 'why don't you become a soldier?'
were ever in my ears; but the thought of my old and
dying parent, of whom I was the only prop and stay,
stifled the more fiery energy that rose within me;
and as we drew near the little covered platform,
where the <i>élite</i> of the spectators were grouped around
that beautiful but stony-hearted Duchess, the canting
Marquis, the two Countesses, Sir Horace and others
of their privileged order, I felt my spirit sink as if I
was a very slave.
</p>

<p>
Here also stood Mr. Ephraim Snaggs, bearing on a
silver salver two purses beautifully embroidered.
One was by the hands of Miss Everingham, and
contained the hundred sovereigns; the other was by her
friend, and contained the fifty.
</p>

<p>
While crimsoned by mortification, I heard my
name pronounced, and found myself before Sir
Horace, who, as the newspapers said, "in a choice,
neat, and appropriate speech," duly emphasised in the
true Oxford fashion, announced that I was <i>the</i> victor of
<i>the</i> shooting-match, and entitled to <i>the</i> first prize&mdash;my
companion to <i>the</i> second.
</p>

<p>
To accept this money seemed to me, educated as I
had been by my proud and haughty mother, the very
acme of shame and humiliation; but, at that bitter
moment, I saw her in fancy stretched on her bed of
sickness, wan with illness and with age, and about to be
forcibly evicted at the stern behest of the very donor
of this wretched coin&mdash;the curse of men, and cause of
all their crime and misery.  But for her sake I would
gladly have scattered the money among the poor Celts
who crowded round us, with exultation in their eyes,
"that Mac Innon himself and no Sassenagh," was the
victor; but I mastered my emotion; the Lowlander's
proverb, <i>he yat tholis overcomes</i>, flashed upon my
memory, and while my cheek burned with a fever
heat, I received the purse from the hand of Laura
Everingham, and again her soft touch gave me a
thrill that went straight to my swollen heart.
</p>

<p>
With all a woman's quickness she divined the
source of my emotion, and said tremulously,
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Mac Innon, you have, I think, some reluctance
in accepting this prize; if you would prefer the
silver cup, I am sure that dear papa&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'No, no, madam; a thousand thanks for your
generous delicacy; but&mdash;but the money&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Will be more acceptable,' added Mr. Snaggs, spitefully.
'We have a proverb among us in Scotland, my
dear Miss Everingham, anent "leaving a legacy to
Mac Gregor."  Mr. Mac Innon is a Highlander, and
possesses, I have no doubt, an accurate idea of the
value of the current coin of these kingdoms.'
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;aw,' drawled the vacant Snobleigh, taking
his cue from the factor, and whom I heard though he
spoke in a whisper, for my sense of hearing was
painfully acute, 'I always thought this young fellow
wondawfully well behaved for a Scotsman, but
aw&mdash;aw&mdash;with all his cussed pwide and politeness he has
taken your tin, Laura.'
</p>

<p>
My breast heaved&mdash;I felt the fire flashing in my
eyes, and I glared at Snaggs with fury, while the
impulse to dirk or shoot him rose within me.
</p>

<p>
'Ephraim Snaggs&mdash;liar, coward, and hypocrite,
utter but another taunt or jeer, and I will strangle
you like the dog you are!' I exclaimed in a voice so
hoarse with passion, that Laura shrunk from me in
terror, while I emptied the hundred sovereigns from
the purse into my right hand, and flung them in a
golden shower among the crowd, a startling and
unexpected manoeuvre, which was immediately imitated
by Callum, who tossed his fifty into the air; and thus
in a moment we were as poor and as desperate as
when the shooting began.
</p>

<p>
While the crowd scrambled for the money among
the grass, a murmur&mdash;a cry of astonishment had risen,
on all sides, and then silence succeeded.
</p>

<p>
'What the devil do you mean, fellow, by refusing
the money?' asked Sir Horace, who seemed highly
irritated that Callum should presume to imitate his
master.
</p>

<p>
'Because I did not come here for money.'
</p>

<p>
'For what then?'
</p>

<p>
'Honour&mdash;like my chief and fosterer Mac Innon.'
</p>

<p>
'Honour?' reiterated the incredulous baronet,
coolly surveying through his glass the erect figure
of the tattered huntsman, from his bonnet to his
brogues.  'Oho, of course you have a pedigree like
a Welshman, beginning with Adam and ending with
yourself.'
</p>

<p>
'In that case it might be no better than your own;
but I am come of a long line of brave men, whose
shoes, the son of a Manchester baronet, rich though
he be, is not worthy to tie.'
</p>

<p>
The claret-reddened cheeks of Sir Horace grew
pale at this fierce hit, while the stately duchess, the
two <i>passé</i> countesses, and all the Highland tabbies of
'good family,' exchanged significant and self-satisfied
smiles.  The baronet was about to make an impetuous
rejoinder, when Clavering said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Sir Horace do, I beg of you, respect the feelings
of these people, whose peculiar temper and ideas you
cannot understand.'
</p>

<p>
'Papa, papa!' urged his startled daughter.
</p>

<p>
'You speak English well&mdash;devilish well, indeed,
for a Highlander,' said Sir Horace loftily, gulping
down his anger; 'how is this?'
</p>

<p>
'I am all unused to answer questions that are
asked in such tones, yet I will satisfy you.'
</p>

<p>
'Do, for never did I meet an ignorant gilly who
spoke so proudly to me.'
</p>

<p>
'A gilly I am, but <i>not</i> an ignorant one, Sir Horace.
Thanks be to God, and to good Father Hamish
Cameron, who now sleeps in his grave in the Scottish
church at Valladolid, I can read and write, and do a
little more.  I am thus unlike the poor people round
me, who are oppressed and destroyed, without
knowing why and wherefore the land of their fathers,
so dear to their hearts, is made a hunting-field for the
dissipated and the idle of the south country, while
they are driven from starvation to exile&mdash;we, the
Gael, who since the Union have led the van of
Britain's bloodiest battles.  But I know that our
enthusiasm, our traditions, and our ties of clanship seem
mere trash and absurdity to such as you, Sir Horace&mdash;a
cold-blooded conventionalist and man of the
world.  I have learned to be aware that the game-laws,
the loss of the kelp trade, misgovernment, and
centralization are the curses of the Highlands&mdash;all
this I know, though I am but a half-lettered gilly!
I know a black-hearted villain when I see one,
Mr. Snaggs, and I know a pampered tyrant when I speak
to one, Sir Horace, and so <i>failte air an duinnewassal!</i>
let us go Mac Innon.'
</p>

<p>
Sir Horace gave us a glance full of spite and anger;
he felt that a peasant had dared to lecture him before
a multitude; but now we marched off with our pipes
playing, leaving the crowd of fashionables staring
after us in astonishment, while the more ignoble
mob still hunted for the scattered gold among the
grass.
</p>

<p>
'We have done right and well, Callum Dhu,' said
I; 'but think of my poor mother and of the eviction
notices?'
</p>

<p>
'Your mother&mdash;ay, poor lady&mdash;there the dirk
enters my heart.'
</p>

<p>
'If moved, she dies.'
</p>

<p>
'Nothing but the prediction of the Red Priest
can save her now,' said Callum, lowering his voice,
'unless we defend the house by musket-shot, for if
she passes its walls, she will die like the wife of
Angus and your great-grandmother, the wife of
Lachlan Mohr.'
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
THE SIXTH DAY.
</h3>

<p>
We marched bravely and with pipes playing, while
we were within sight of the crowds assembled on the
green braes at the foot of the stupendous Ben; but
as soon as we had crossed the shoulder of the mountain,
and begun to descend into that beautiful valley
from which we were all about to be expelled, our
spirit sank and the wild notes of Ewen's <i>Piob Mohr</i>
died away, while dejected and silent, or communing
only in low and foreboding whispers, the men of our
fated tribe approached their humble homes.
</p>

<p>
The aged, the women, and the little ones came
forth to meet and to welcome with acclamations, and
outstretched arms the victors of the different games.
The crest-fallen bearing of Black Callum and myself
led them at first to suppose what they had hitherto
believed to be impossible and incredible, that we hail
been beaten at rifle-shooting 'by the strangers.'
</p>

<p>
When I left the glen that morning, all my thoughts
were bent on victory, and I saw only one thing in
the world&mdash;a black spot on a white target; but <i>now</i>
the blue eyes of Laura Everingham were ever before
me, in all their variety and beauty of expression.
</p>

<p>
My mother's feeble voice fell sadly and reproachfully
on my ear as I entered her chamber, and Minnie,
drawing back the curtains, revealed the thin and
aged form that seemed to be passing like a shadow
from among us.
</p>

<p>
'You have won the prize, my dear boy, Allan?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, mother.'
</p>

<p>
Her eyes were bent in love and sorrow on me.
Oh, how full my heart was at that moment!
</p>

<p>
'A hundred guineas, Allan&mdash;think of that!'
</p>

<p>
'And Callum won the second prize,' said Minnie,
with a timid blush of pleasure.
</p>

<p>
'Fifty more&mdash;one hundred and fifty!  Oh, Allan,
my poor boy.  God's blessed hand was in this, to save
us from the grasp of ruin!'
</p>

<p>
I wrung my hands, and throwing the empty purses
before my mother, covered my face and sat down.
</p>

<p>
'What means this, Allan?' asked the poor woman,
in a voice of tenderness and alarm; but I made no
reply.  'An empty purse, you have not&mdash;oh, you
cannot have spent or lost the money?'
</p>

<p>
'Neither, dear mother&mdash;but pity me and bear with
the weakness you have taught me?'
</p>

<p>
'What have you done?'
</p>

<p>
'Listen and you shall hear.'
</p>

<p>
I detailed to her the shooting, and told how
Callum and I were the victors at any distance from
one to five hundred yards, and how we showered our
bullets into the bull's-eye, as fast as the markers could
count them; how we challenged all to shoot seven
consecutive balls into the black cross on the tower of
the Thanes; how none save Callum and I could touch
it at two hundred yards&mdash;a feat such as the
Highlands had seldom seen before, and how we won the
prizes.
</p>

<p>
I related how the hateful Snaggs had been there
with musty morality on his oily tongue, and a hateful
smile in his deep grey eye; how he had uttered
sneers to which (without seeming to commit an
outrage) I could not reply.  I told her of the shame I
endured when competing with shepherds and foresters
for a prize, even from a lady's hand.  I the heir of an
old and respected line, and with all the pride in which
<i>she</i> had reared me, swelling in my heart; I told her
of the wily factor's taunts, and how Callum and I had
flung the gold with scorn among the people, and
departed from that great and long wished-for gathering
on the Braes as poor as when this morning, so full of
hope and spirit, we had marched over the mountains
to attend it.
</p>

<p>
My mother heard me quietly to the end, and then
applauded me as warmly as her feeble strength would
permit.  But I failed to feel this approval in my own
heart, when beholding the emptiness of our
household&mdash;the lack of comforts&mdash;yea almost of common
food; and I cursed the pride that made me scorn a
prize, which though less than a bagatelle to
some&mdash;to you, my good reader, I hope&mdash;would have been a
Godsend to our half-famished family at Glen Ora.
</p>

<p>
Then Laura's face and eyes, her voice and accents
came before me, and I fell, I knew not why, into a
dreamy reverie over all I did.
</p>

<p>
My mother's illness and our penury pressed heavily
on my soul.  A lofty barrier seemed to surround me;
a girdle of evils&mdash;a boundary beyond which I saw no
outlet, from which there was no escape, and which I
dared not and knew not how to surmount.  Too
proud to beg, and ashamed to dig, I became bewildered
as the evil hour approached, when the authorities
would arrive to evict the people of the glen.
For the whole of the previous day no food passed my
lips; I found eating impossible, I felt as one over
whom hung a sentence of death; a dark, inevitable,
and unavertible fate; and with the apathy of despair
I saw the morning of the sixth day dawn, when the
messengers and constables, or perhaps the soldiery
from Fort William, would arrive to extinguish the
fires, unroof the houses, and drive the people away.
</p>

<p>
Thoughts of armed, manly, and determined resistance
floated darkly and fiercely through my mind;
and I am certain that the same ideas were hovering
before Callum, as he sat by his humble but untasted
breakfast, sharpening his skene dhu, cleaning, oiling
and examining his favourite rifle, the crack of which
might never more wake the echoes of the mountains;
and our pretty Minnie watched him the while with
loving and anxious eyes.  There were weapons
enough in the cottages to arm the men of the glen,
and their number was sufficient to have held against
three thousand red coats, the gorge that led to the
valley, for there our grandfathers had made a long
and desperate defence against the ruffianly Huskes
Brigade in 1746, and <i>we</i> were able to do as much
again; but the steamers had opened up the lochs in
our rear; and though we might have repelled the
authorities for a few days, we were sure of being
overcome and severely chastised in the end; thus
the rash and dangerous idea to taking arms to defend
our old hereditary hearths and homes was no sooner
formed than it was dismissed.
</p>

<p>
At night I could scarcely sleep, and if for a moment
my eyes closed, distressing visions of flaming
houses, and of women and children dragged forth by
rural police and soldiers, came before me.  I heard
my mother crying for succour&mdash;but invisible powers
seemed to chain my feet to the earth, and breathlessly
I writhed and strove to aid her.  Perspiration
bedewed my forehead, when hands were roughly laid
upon her bed to bear her forth, for the hour of
eviction had come, and I remembered the widow of
Lachlan Mohr.  Then I was free&mdash;I sprang to my
father's sword; but our tormentors flung themselves
upon me!  My mother was borne forth&mdash;now&mdash;<i>now</i>,
she was at the threshold.  I heard a faint cry, and
all was over&mdash;she had expired!  Then I would start
up, with my heart full of horror, grief, and vengeance,
to find that it was all a dream; but, alas, a dark and
foreboding one!
</p>

<p>
The sixth day dawned.  It drew slowly and heavily
on&mdash;it passed away, and night darkened without
Ewen Oig, who was posted as a scout on the lofty
brow of the Craig-na-tuirc, seeing any sign of the
dreaded authorities approaching by the road which,
like a slender thread between the giant hills, wound
away in the distance towards the capital of the
Highlands.
</p>

<p>
A little hope began to gather in my heart.
</p>

<p>
But they might come on the morrow.
</p>

<p>
My mother had caught the feverish excitement that
reigned in our little household, and from the crooning
and croaking of old Mhari, soon learned the doom
that hung over us, and it had a most fatal effect upon
her frail and delicate constitution.  She became
dangerously ill; in her face I read that sad and terrible
expression which comes but once, and my soul
sickened with alarm!
</p>

<p>
After a late and hasty meal of broiled venison
(poached by Callum), and shared with a staghound
and the sheep collies, I despatched my fosterer with all
speed for the doctor of the district, while I buckled
on my dirk, and departed for the new manor-house of
Glen Ora, to seek an interview with Sir Horace, and
crave for my mother a little delay&mdash;that mercy which
I disdained to seek for myself.
</p>

<p>
'The moon <i>is full</i>,' said Callum, as we separated;
'it is a lucky time to undertake anything.'
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap16"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
SIR HORACE.
</h3>

<p>
I soon reached the large and handsome modern villa,
which crowned the plateau, where the square tower
of the Mac Innons had been, for seven hundred years,
the landmark of the glens.  The hour was eight; but
the baronet and his friends were still at the dinner-table,
and the brilliance of the wax-lights in the four
tall windows of the magnificent dining-room, seemed
to straggle with the bright flush of evening that
reddened the sky above the darkening mountains of the
west.
</p>

<p>
Through a spacious marble vestibule, adorned by
gilded cornices, marble statues, and deer's horns, I
was ushered by the plushed and powdered Mr. Jeames
Toodles, into an illuminated billiard-room, and here
he asked me for my card.
</p>

<p>
'Card!' reiterated I, reddening, for I had never
discovered a use for such a thing before; 'no card is
required; say that Allan Mac Innon wishes to speak
with Sir Horace, without a moment's delay.'
</p>

<p>
The valet gave a supercilious smile; but, on
perceiving me throw a hasty glance towards a rack of
billiard-cues, he made a hasty retreat.  After remaining
for some time alone, and with no other company
than my own bitter and galling reflections, I found
the valet before me again; Sir Horace was just finishing
dinner, and afterwards had to confer with a
gentleman on business.
</p>

<p>
'And cannot see me?' I exclaimed, making a stride
towards the speaker&mdash;a gesture which caused him to
shuffle backward in terror; my heather-coloured kilt
and fierce free mountaineer bearing had in them
something new and appalling to him.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Toodles did not mean to say that exactly; Sir
Horace would see me in the course of a few minutes;
meantime, would I join Captain Clavering and
Mr. Snobleigh, who were lingering over their wine, before
ascending to the drawing-room?  I bowed, and
followed the valet mechanically, with a breast that
swelled with many strange emotions.  If I
committed, in thought, the double sin of covetousness
and envy on that occasion, when contrasting the
humility, plainness, and penury of my dilapidated
home with the splendour and luxury I beheld, it was
not for myself, but for the sake of one whom I felt
assured would not be long spared to me now; and
whom not even the prediction of the Red Priest could
protect from the hand of the Spoiler.
</p>

<p>
From the walnut sideboard the liveried servants
were removing the dinner, the rich and overpowering
odour of which filled that loftily ceiled, heavily
curtained and gorgeous dining-room.  To me it seemed
a scene from a romance.  The vases were richly gilt
and mounted with precious stones; the dessert, <i>entree</i>
dishes, the soup-tureens, ashets, &amp;c., with which the
powdered lacqueys were trotting to and fro, were all
of silver exquisitely chased; so were the classic
wine-coolers, with the champagne in ice, and the ponderous
branches of six wax-lights each.  The wassail-bowl
of silver had already made its tour; and at a side-table
was the coffee simmering, and served in antique
china and silver.
</p>

<p>
But the coffee was neglected, for Clavering, Snobleigh,
and two or three other sporting visitors, with
Sheriff Mac Fee, were loitering over their wine, fruit,
and nuts; and the long polished table was resplendent
with tall crystal decanters of the baronet's rare old
port, vintage '34, sherry pure as amber, amontillado,
first-growth claret, and straw-coloured champagne,
foaming in goblet-shaped glasses, while old Hock,
Stienberger, Malaga, and Moselle, stood in battalion
under the sideboard, or in a cluster under the gigantic
epergne.
</p>

<p>
'Welcome Mac Innon&mdash;delighted to see you, old
fellow!' exclaimed Clavering, assuming the part of
host.
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;aw&mdash;how aw you?' added Snobleigh.
</p>

<p>
'Toodles, a chair for Mr. Mac Innon&mdash;wish you
had come sooner&mdash;Sir Horace would have been happy
to have seen you at dinner I am assured&mdash;hope you
have dined, though?  Ah&mdash;well, fill your glass&mdash;Toodles,
champagne here, and pass the claret-jug.'
</p>

<p>
Sad, anxious, and most unhappy, I was silent, and
drained the crystal goblet of champagne.  Then my
spirit warmed a little, and I joined in the conversation
which naturally rose on local subjects, such as
deer-stalking, grouse-shooting, and the famous white
stag of Loch Ora, which many persons believed to be
a myth, as no one could wound or kill it.
</p>

<p>
Even Mr. Fungus Mac Fee, the sheriff, could speak
on these matters; but to me, always rather superciliously,
because he knew but too well that my family
was fallen and poor; while he always deferred to
Mr. Snobleigh, who knew as much about deer-stalking
as of squaring the circle, or adjusting the longitude.
This sheriff knew intuitively that I hated him.
</p>

<p>
After toadying to his party, spinning out a subsistence
by scribbling in magazines and papers in defence
of it; after writing, with the same laudable view, a
history of Scotland, in which the clans were handled
with such severity, and one might suppose the soul
of Cumberland had been in his ink-bottle, Mr. Mac
Fee found himself sheriff of a county; and after
denouncing on the hustings, and through the medium
of a journal (long notorious in Scotland for its
anti-nationality, its hatred of the Celtic race, and for
being the special utensil of the Government,) the
waste of one administration, he had no objection to
accept of numerous sinecures for himself and his
connections, under their successors; hence, he scraped a
sufficient sum to purchase the small estate of
Druckendubh.  He was naturally coarse, argumentative,
and full of vapour and authority; but here, among
men of undisputed wealth and position&mdash;at least, the
position which wealth insures to every blockhead in
this conventional age&mdash;Fungus Mac Fee was the most
bland and suave of mankind.
</p>

<p>
'Any news to-day, Mr. Mac Innon?' asked the
sheriff, raising his impudent eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
'None, sir,' said I, sharply, for our Scottish
placeman knew enough of Highland courtesy to be aware
that the prefix was offensive to me.
</p>

<p>
'Have you not heard that the Russians have crossed
the Pruth in two places, and mean to occupy
Wallachia and Moldavia?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; but I have other things to think of, Mr. Mac
Fee, and I wish, in my soul, that they were crossing
the Braes of Loch Ora.'
</p>

<p>
'A deuced odd wish that!' said Captain Clavering,
'but perhaps you don't like that straw-coloured
champagne&mdash;try the pink.'
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;try the claret-jug&mdash;you'll aw&mdash;find it rathaw
the thing, said the languid Snobleigh, smoothing his
bandolined moustache; 'Sir Horace is engaged in the
library&mdash;aw&mdash;just now, with Mr. Snaggs&mdash;such a
howibble name!&mdash;on business.  Dem business&mdash;wish
there was no such thing in the world; Snaggs is
always annoying Sir Horace about something or other.'
</p>

<p>
My heart sank lower on hearing this; for even in
this visit to the baronet, fate seemed to have conspired
against me; but I should have remembered that
naturally Sir Horace was frequently engaged in
consultations with Snaggs, for being of a proud and
tyrannical disposition, he was ever squabbling about
rights and points of etiquette; taking offence where
none was intended, and waging a legal&mdash;and to
Snaggs most profitable&mdash;war, with the neighbouring
proprietors, farmers, shepherds, and poachers.
</p>

<p>
'Fine girl that was, whom we met at the gathering
the other day,' said the captain.
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;vewy, for a Scots girl&mdash;but, aw&mdash;a little
metaphysical,' responded Snobleigh, sleepily cracking
a nut.
</p>

<p>
'Magnificent hand and arm, though!'
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;rathaw&mdash;but she was so dooced pwoud.'
</p>

<p>
'She will have something handsome, gentlemen,'
said Mac Fee, draining a glass of champagne at one
vulgar gulp; 'when the people give place to fine
fat sheep on her land.  She is an heiress, and when
six or eight of the small farms are formed into
<i>one</i>&mdash;and you are pleased with her, captain?'
</p>

<p>
'f thought her the prettiest of all pretty girls&mdash;but
flirting with her&mdash;pass the claret, thanks&mdash;would
be mere waste of powder.  I must keep my ammunition
for better game.'
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;Laura Everingham, I presume,' said
Snobleigh, with a little spite in his eye and tone.
</p>

<p>
The Captain coloured slightly; a shade of annoyance
crossed his brow, and regardless that I and
others were present, Snobleigh continued to chatter
away; and even this exasperated me, for misfortune
had rendered me unduly sensitive.
</p>

<p>
'I assure you, Clavering, that girl Everingham will
come in for a jolly good thing or two, when Sir Horace
departs to a better world.  I&mdash;aw&mdash;fished it all out
of old Snaggs the other night by quoting Blair, and
passing the bottle, so I'm a devilish good mind to&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What&mdash;pop the question, eh?'
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Then you may save yourself trouble, Snob, my
boy, for she has refused me already, and other two of
the Household Brigade: but I don't despair yet&mdash;for
I have the governor's interest.'
</p>

<p>
'And you proposed&mdash;aw&mdash;the devil! this was
rathaw an extensive proceeding.  I thought that I
knew how to manage horses and women too.  For
that, one requires considerable&mdash;aw&mdash;.'
</p>

<p>
'What?'
</p>

<p>
'Study&mdash;aw perseverance and care.'
</p>

<p>
'The ladies are infinitely obliged to you,' said Mac
Fee.
</p>

<p>
'The future Mrs. Snobleigh particularly so,'
laughed Clavering; 'Toodles, fill that devil of a claret
jug&mdash;what the deuce is Sir Horace about?'
</p>

<p>
'Snaggs and he must have arranged some pretty
extensive clearances by this time,' suggested the
sheriff, with a furtive glance at me.
</p>

<p>
'In truth, Clavering,' said Snobleigh, who had
been pondering a little; 'I aw&mdash;would feel restless
with a wife so simple and handsome among the gay
fellows of the Household Brigade.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;you would be like the husband some one
writes about, who,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "While Suspicion robs him of his ease,<br />
  Peculiar danger in a <i>red coat</i> sees;<br />
  Envies each handsome fellow whom he spies.<br />
  And feels his <i>horns</i> at every <i>cornet</i> rise."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Eh&mdash;ha ha, ha!'
</p>

<p>
'Dem husbands&mdash;I hate them all.'
</p>

<p>
'Talking of the Brigade, have you heard of
Jernyngham of your battalion lately?'
</p>

<p>
'He was well cleaned out before he&mdash;aw&mdash;disappeared
from London; but don't know him now, poor
devil.'
</p>

<p>
'It was at this "poor devil's" table you spent some
of your happiest hours,' said Clavering, reproachfully.
There was a pause, during which I turned towards
the door, sick of this empty conversation, and
impatient to see the baronet.  After the learned Mac Fee
had delivered himself for the tenth time of some
stereotyped remarks on the heat of the weather, and
the excellence of the wine, Mr. Snobleigh observed
with his most languid air.
</p>

<p>
'I am tired of this kind of thing, and must go
back to town.  Horrid slow here in the
'Ighlands&mdash;and&mdash;aw&mdash;slow fellows all round about.  Laura
Everingham is chawming, no doubt; and&mdash;aw&mdash;your
sister, Clavering, imparts quite a London air to the
whole place; but I&mdash;aw&mdash;still long for Town.  One
always saves something, however, in this bawbawous
wegion&mdash;beg pardon, Mr. Mac Fee, but&mdash;aw&mdash;aw&mdash;'tis
so.  Had Jernyngham been here, his stud had never
been pounded at Tattersall's&mdash;his commission at
Greenwood's, or his plate by aw&mdash;aw&mdash;the Lord's
chosen people.  Now, for instance, in the matter of
gloves; in Town, I&mdash;aw&mdash;I take a walk&mdash;and spoil a
pair; I take a canter along Rotten Row, or in Hyde
Pawk, another pair; dinner, another pair, and for the
opera or a ball, another pair, and&mdash;aw&mdash;aw&mdash;so on.
And then when one is in debt, as of course everybody
is but low scoundrels, the&mdash;aw&mdash;the saving in many
things here is enormous; besides, one aw&mdash;acquires
the habit of early rising.'
</p>

<p>
'So the Highlands are not without their
advantages?' said I.
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;yes.  In London, if not for duty at Kensington
or the Tower, I breakfast at one, on coffee
and a cigaw; but here I rise at ten appetised like an
'Ighland 'awk&mdash;a glass of liqueur&mdash;tea, coffee, ham,
tongue, game, fowl&mdash;aw, aw&mdash;dinner ditto; and after
knocking about the balls a little, and having a <i>deux
temps</i> with Laura, or a game at guinea points, then
a devilled bone and champagne&mdash;then to bed at two
in the morning&mdash;at <i>two!</i> aw&mdash;think of that
Clavering&mdash;how Gothic&mdash;oh&mdash;aw&mdash;infernally!'
</p>

<p>
'Now,' said the sheriff, 'what say you to our
proposed little game at écarté?'
</p>

<p>
'Bravo I&mdash;aw must have my revenge on Clavering;
he walked into me for aw&mdash;one thousand two
hundred.'
</p>

<p>
'So much?' exclaimed Mac Fee, aghast.
</p>

<p>
'Aw yes.'
</p>

<p>
'I have his little bill for it, at three months, with
a promise to renew,' said Clavering, laughing.
</p>

<p>
'Then what shall we have to-night?'
</p>

<p>
'Whist&mdash;at crown points.'
</p>

<p>
'No higher?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;I have a thousand pounds on that devilish
horse at the Oaks, and must trot easily.'
</p>

<p>
'Whist be it, then;' and here they rose to adjourn,
leaving me confounded by the ease with which they
spoke of sums that to my simple Highland
comprehension seemed enormous.
</p>

<p>
'Toodles&mdash;aw order some pink champagne and
cigars to the card-room.'
</p>

<p>
'Cigars if you will,' said Clavering; 'but no
champagne; dem it, no&mdash;I shall drink no more
to-night of anything stronger than Father Adam's pale
ale, while playing with <i>you</i>,' and just as they all left
the dining-room by one door, I heard the voice of Sir
Horace in communication with Snaggs, approaching
it by another.
</p>

<p>
'To-morrow will decide the affair,' said Sir Horace,
pausing with his fingers on the crystal door-handle.
</p>

<p>
'To-morrow or the day after, at latest, my dear
sir,' responded the bland voice of Snaggs.
</p>

<p>
'Of course I am deuced sorry for the old woman,
and all that sort of thing&mdash;for she must be very
unhappy; but we have a great duty to perform&mdash;a great
duty to society, Mr. Snaggs, and old women must not
stand in the way of improvement.'
</p>

<p>
'To be sure, my dear Sir Horace; "every age,"
says the divine Blair, will prove burdensome to those
who have no fund of happiness in their breast&mdash;and
as for the young desperado her son, nothing whatever
can be made of him.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course not; his head is filled with such quaint
ideas and old Highland stuff, unsuited to modern
times, habits, and usages, that he is a mere wild colt,
and twice I have been told, pulled out of his
stocking,&mdash;what do you call it?'
</p>

<p>
'Skene Dhu, or Black Knife, my dear sir,' suggested
Mr. Snaggs.
</p>

<p>
'Ah yea&mdash;a skin doo, upon you, sir.  I know not
why these Highland fellows are allowed to bristle
about with their daggers and skenes, when there are
laws passed against the wearing of arms.  But the
truth is, the sooner that this young fellow and his
people are sent off to America by the <i>Sutherland</i>, under
Captain Sellars, the better.  There are some fine
swamps to drain, moors to cultivate, and woods to
cut down in the Cunadas; and as for that great
ruffian Cullum Dhu, who nearly murdered poor
Toodles the other day&mdash;dem the fellow, I'll have him
transported!  Adversity teaches these fierce spirits no
lesson.'
</p>

<p>
'True, my dear Sir Horace,' chimed in the moralist;
'"adversity," exclaims the divine Blair, "how blunt
are all the arrows of thy quiver, compared with those
of guilt!"'
</p>

<p>
'Dem Blair&mdash;I am quite sick of him, too; but let
us have a glass of Moselle, and then we'll join the
ladies in the drawing-room.  <i>You</i> here, Mr. Mac Innon!'
he exclaimed, with angry surprise on seeing
me; 'how do ye do, sir,' he added, with a dark
countenance; 'my friend Mr. Snaggs and I have just
closed a long conversation about you.'
</p>

<p>
'I am sorry to hear it, Sir Horace, for now I fear
my visit here is bootless.'
</p>

<p>
'You judge most correctly, if you have come to ask
delay about my projected clearances.'
</p>

<p>
There was a glare in the sharp eye, and a smile on
the thin lips of Snaggs, as Sir Horace said this.  I
felt my eyes flash fire as anger gathered in my heart;
for heaven never intended me either for a temporiser
or a diplomatist.
</p>

<p>
'I was about to speak to you, Sir Horace, not of
myself, but of my mother, who is aged, sickly, infirm,
and unable to comprehend how any power on earth
possesses a law to expel her from Glen Ora.'
</p>

<p>
'Now, young man, you irritate me!  This is the
rock upon which all you Celts split your very obtuse
heads.  The good lady, your mother, with the rest of
the people on that portion of my estate, must learn
that the tenant has no right in the soil.'
</p>

<p>
'None whatever, legally or morally,' added Snaggs.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Your</i> property!' I replied, trembling with passion;
'it would have been as much as your head is worth
to have said this to a Mac Innon on the spot where
you stand, a hundred years&mdash;ay fifty years ago.  But
it is of my mother I would speak&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, sir&mdash;excuse me&mdash;I will hear nothing; moreover,
your presence here is an unwarrantable intrusion;
the ladies, Mr. Snaggs, await us at coffee.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh for a curse upon him whose mad extravagance
and folly brought my father's son to this humiliation!'

CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
MR. SNOBLEIGH.
</h3>

<p>
From the illuminated marble vestibule, I plunged out
into the darkness of the night, and goaded by my
fierce and terrible thoughts, was rushing down the
avenue, when in my confusion I stumbled against a
marble Psyche, that stood in the centre of the
carriage-way, about a pistol-shot from the door, and fell,
stunned and almost breathless beside the pedestal.
</p>

<p>
I thought of my feeble mother about to be torn
from the roof that had sheltered her so long; I
thought of my brave father now beneath the sod, and
of his fathers in that old ancestral burial-place, where
'shaded by sepulchral yew,' lay the warriors and the
patriarchs of our tribe, and where I would never lie;
I thought of all that had been, but could never be
again; the stirring past, with all its shadowy glory;
the humiliating present with all its bitterness; the
dark and dubious future with all its doubts and
fears; and a storm&mdash;a devouring fever&mdash;raged within
me!
</p>

<p>
Placing my hands upon my temples, I pressed my
hot and throbbing brow upon the cold marble pedestal,
and endeavoured to reflect and to breathe.
</p>

<p>
The three windows of the drawing-room, which in
the French fashion, were constructed to open down
to the Portsoy marble steps that descended to the
lawn, were all unclosed, as the heat of the atmosphere
was great, and the luxury, lights, and music within
made me scan for a moment this magnificent apartment
from the place where I lingered.  It was
crowded by objects of <i>virtû</i>, and the subdued lights of
the crystal chandeliers, and chaste girondoles, fell on
antique Sevrès and China vases; on oriental jars and
Dresden china plateaux; on the Warwick vase in
verde antique; on velvet hangings draperied up with
gold; on Dianas and Apollos, &amp;c.; on Rosso de
Lavanti marble pillars; on bronzes and Medician vases,
glittering antique buhl and or-molu tables, and all
that might please the eye, or gratify the whim of a
moment.
</p>

<p>
The notes of a piano&mdash;one of Errard's best&mdash;and the
voice of a female singing, came towards me, and I
raised myself from the ground on my elbow to listen.
My heart beat wildly.  The air was soft and sad and
touching; and&mdash;though then unknown to me&mdash;it was
the divine <i>Spirito Gentil</i> from the opera of Donizetti.
She who sang was Laura, and my ears drank in every
gentle note; the fierce conflict of pride and passion
died away within me; my heart was melted by the
gentler emotions that Laura's influence roused, and I
could have wept&mdash;but not a tear would come.
</p>

<p>
I could see her figure, with Clavering standing
beside her, patting time with his gloved hand, and
turning over the leaves of the address to Leonora.  I
wished him any place but there.
</p>

<p>
Laura looked charming!
</p>

<p>
From the crystal girandoles that stood on the little
carved brackets of the piano, the light fell in bright
rays over her black silk dress, which, in its darkness,
contrasted strongly with the pure whiteness of her
beautiful neck and delicate hands.  Her face was full
of sweetness and animation, and her soft voice so
delightfully modulated, was full of an enthusiasm that
lent her usually pale cheek a flush, as she sang that
winning Italian air with all its requisite pathos.
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;vewy well&mdash;she does sing diwinely!' said
a voice near me.  'Alboni&mdash;even little Piccolomini
herself, could not surpass her.'
</p>

<p>
'Hush&mdash;pray,' said another.
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;now it is ended&mdash;bravo!'
</p>

<p>
Close by me were Mr. Mac Fee the sheriff, and
Mr. Snobleigh, smoking each a choice cuba, and
hovering so near the marble Psyche, that I dared not
move, lest I should be observed and suspected of
eaves-dropping.
</p>

<p>
'A dooced bad cigaw,' said Snobleigh, endeavouring
to light a refractory cabana, and swaying about
in a manner that sufficiently indicated how the fumes
of the champagne had mounted into that vacuum
where his brains should have been; 'dem&mdash;I think
your 'Ighland air spoils them; and aw&mdash;aw&mdash;you
admire Laura&mdash;eh; aw&mdash;now it draws; a fine girl&mdash;say
yes&mdash;why the devil don't you say yes?'
</p>

<p>
'Beautiful&mdash;and you are tender in that quarter?'
simpered the servile Mac Fee.
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;yes, and have some devilish serious thoughts
of matrimony, too.'
</p>

<p>
'Marriage is a serious thing, Mr. Snobleigh.'
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;yes&mdash;demmed serious when one marries age,
ugliness, or aw&mdash;poverty; but with, with a charming
young person like Miss Everingham&mdash;it alters the
case entirely.  But don't you observe, old fellow, that
Laura talks too much of that aw&mdash;aw&mdash;peculiar
individual&mdash;that species of outlaw, as Mr. Snaggs names
him&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Young Mac Innon?'
</p>

<p>
'Dem! yes&mdash;but to teaze me of course.  What is
that now?  Fanny Clavering at her
aw&mdash;aw&mdash;everlasting song&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I dare not seek to offer thee<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A timid love like mine&mdash;"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
'Like hers indeed&mdash;aw&mdash;aw&mdash;ha! ha! it has been
offered to half the fellows in the Household Brigade.
Curse that pink champagne&mdash;it makes one so devilish
shaky in the aw&mdash;legs.  Yes&mdash;Laura has talked so
much about this 'Ighland colt, Mac Innon, ever since
the shooting-match, that I&mdash;aw don't half like it.  In
fact, Clavering&mdash;a good judge of both horses and
aw&mdash;women&mdash;swears that she loves him.'
</p>

<p>
'You cannot be serious?'
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;yes, frightfully serious.  But only think of
a girl like Laura troubling her&mdash;aw head about such
a wild Highland Sawney Bean?  I should like to see
him handling my yacht, the <i>Bruiser</i>, in a stiff
nor'-easter off Cowes; taking the mettle out of a
four-in-hand team; aw&mdash;making up his book on the Derby;
widing the winnaw at the Oaks; knocking the balls
about at billiards, or aw&mdash;aw&mdash;getting a child of
Judah to fork out the tip, or achieving anything else
that savours of town life, or of civilization.  The
chawming Laura in love with him indeed; 'pon my
soul the idea is&mdash;aw too absawd!'
</p>

<p>
'Absurd, indeed,' chorused Mr. Mac Fee.
</p>

<p>
'Absawd&mdash;my dear fellow, absawd!' added Snobleigh,
as he staggered away, followed by the
obsequious Mac Fee.
</p>

<p>
Laura spoke of me frequently, and Clavering
thought she loved me!
</p>

<p>
Loved me&mdash;could it be credible, or was it the mere
jest of a heedless heart, that linked our names
together&mdash;a linking that, in love, has a nameless charm
to the young, the timid, the tender, and the true.
What a tumult was raised in my breast by this casual
revelation!  I scarcely dared to breathe.  If aught
was wanting to increase the bitterness of the struggle
waged by pride and love within me, it was the words
of the thoughtless Snobleigh.
</p>

<p>
But these bright hopes of a vague and joyous
future&mdash;and all their train of burning thoughts and
ardent aspirations, were doomed to be crushed and
forgotten for a time, by the terrible tidings awaiting
me at my desolate home.
</p>

<p>
Midnight was close at hand, when, turning away
from this abode of luxury and splendour, where every
comfort that wealth can procure surrounded the cold
and selfish Sir Horace and his pampered household, I
bent my steps towards the mountains, and by a
narrow path through a dark and moonless copsewood&mdash;or
rather, an old primeval forest of the Middle Ages,
I hastened towards Glen Ora.
</p>

<p>
I had much to reflect on, and above all the flood of
bitter and anxious thoughts that rolled like a dark
and tempestuous sea around me, I saw the image of
Laura Everingham; for, boy like, and full of mountain
poetry, legendary lore, and old enthusiasm, to me she
naturally became a goddess, and the guiding-star of
all my hopes and aspirations; while serving to temper
with something of reason the fiery anger with which
I was tempted to regard the cruelty and harshness of
her father; who, like too many of our new Highland
proprietors, was but the slave of mammon and the tool
of a cunning factor.
</p>

<p>
While threading my way&mdash;somewhat hastily I
confess&mdash;through a deep and savage cairn, which was
terrible of old as the shade of a mysterious spirit&mdash;a
rushing sound, a crashing of branches struck my ear,
and something white passed near me, like a sunbeam,
or a flash of fire.
</p>

<p>
'The white stag!' I exclaimed, in a breathless
voice, and involuntarily grasped my dirk, while the
perspiration started to my brow; for by an old
tradition in the glen, it was affirmed, that whenever
danger was near the race of Mac Innon, a <i>white stag</i>
crossed the Braes of Loch Ora.
</p>

<p>
'My mother! my mother!' was my next thought,
and like a mountain deer, I sprang away to reach the
old jointure-house of our family.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap18"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
DEATH.
</h3>

<p>
Dawn was stealing across the dun slopes of Ben Ora
and the grey rocky scalps of the Craig-na-tuirc, when
I reached the crest of a hill which overhung my
mother's residence; and there I paused to draw
breath, and to survey a scene which, though familiar
to me as the features of my own face, never lost the
charm of its lonely beauty.
</p>

<p>
Diminished by distance, the little thatched cottages
in the glen seemed less than molehills, but green and
silent, dotting the slope far down below, while above
them rose the stupendous mountains piled up, crest
on crest, to heaven.  From the humble roofs, the
smoke was beginning to ascend in long spiral columns
into the clear and ambient air, as the poor, but thrifty
housewives of the glen prepared their fires of
guisse-monaye&mdash;the bogwood and black peat.
</p>

<p>
In this vast Highland solitude where I paused the
breeze bore to the ear no sound of domestic life; no
sheep bleated, as of old, on the green hill side;
no horse neighed or cow lowed in the ample glen
beneath, for the poor cottagers had long since parted
with all for sustenance; but there rang the ceaseless
rush of the torrent, which plashed and glittered as it
tore through the corrie; the whirr of the plover, the
hum of the heather-bee, or the distant roar of the
rutting hind, as he rose from his dewy lair among the
feathery bracken beside yonder old grey battle-cairn.
Even these sounds were faint or undefined, and all
nature seemed as motionless and still, as the stately
stag with giant horns, that stood on a pinnacle of
rock, against the rosy flush of the eastern sky.  He
seemed to be surveying the scene; then he moved his
lofty antlers, and lo! between me and the gorgeous
blaze of light that overspread the east, and threw out
in black relief the sharp jagged outline of the rocky
hill, there rose a forest of branching antlers, as, in
obedience to their king, a noble herd of deer, calves,
hinds, and harts, three thousand head and more, stood
for a minute as if to show their whole array, and then
with slow and measured steps, descended and wound
down the mountain side, until they disappeared
among the sandy ravines and bushy corries which the
streams and storms of ages have torn and riven in the
bosom of Ben Ora.
</p>

<p>
There had been a great stalking expedition in the
forests of the West, and the gillies of the Marquis of
Drumalbane had been driving the deer for many
miles along the shore; hence the collection of this
vast herd, but amidst its masses I could discern no
trace of a <i>white</i> stag.  Then, whence the vision of
last night?  Was this animal indeed supernatural,
and the harbinger of evil, as tradition affirmed it
to be?
</p>

<p>
My gloomy forebodings increased as the brilliance
of morning descended from the mountain slopes into
the deep and dreamy glens, and as I hastened down
the narrow path which led to my mother's house.
No smoke was wreathing upward from its chimneys,
and there was an aspect of still life about it which
surprised and alarmed me.  The door was wide
open&mdash;an unusual circumstance.  Anon, I saw a number
of persons hastening to and fro between the cottages
of the glen, and a little crowd of men and women
gradually collected round the house.  A deadly terror
smote my heart, and every pulse stood still.  Then
my ears tingled, as a cry of lamentation woke the
silent echoes of the valley.  I sprang down the
mountain side, rushed through the startled clachan,
and at the door of the house met old Mhari, her eyes
red with weeping.  She threw her arms round me.
</p>

<p>
'My mother?' I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'She is dying!' replied the sobbing woman, in her
own figurative language; 'she must soon be laid in
the Place of Sleep, with her feet to the rising sun.'
</p>

<p>
'Dying!' I ejaculated.
</p>

<p>
'Why protract the poor lad's misery?' said a
gentleman, who wore a suit of accurate black, with a
white neckcloth, and silver spectacles, and whom I
knew to be the doctor of the district, and a great
enemy of old Mhari, for whose universal specific for
all complaints (wild garlic boiled with May butter)
he had a great contempt; 'why add to what he must
suffer?&mdash;tell him at once, that he may bear his loss
like a Christian and a man.  Mac Innon, your mother
is dead&mdash;God help you, my poor fellow!'
</p>

<p>
It was so&mdash;dead&mdash;and now I had not a relation,
not a friend in the world, but the poor people of the
glen, to whom I was bound by the common ties of
clanship and descent.  On learning that I had gone
to visit Sir Horace, and knowing well my fiery
temper and proud disposition, my mother's gentle
breast had been filled by a hundred tender anxieties
and thoughts of danger.  Finding herself alone for a
little space, animated by what purpose heaven only
knows&mdash;perhaps by a restless desire to breathe the
fresh air of the glen for the last time; perhaps to
look for me, or perhaps to test the worth of the old
tradition, and so rid herself of a life that had become
a burden; inspired by some mysterious impulse, and
endued thereby with more than her wonted strength
of thought and purpose, she had robed herself in a
plaid and wrapper, and left her bed unseen, for she
was found dead&mdash;dead on the rustic seat beside the
porch, and consequently <i>beyond</i> the walls of the
jointure-house.  Here she was found by Callum Dhu,
on his returning with our doctor, a dapper little
country practitioner, whose attempts to restore
animation proved utterly unavailing.
</p>

<p>
'Dhia!  Dhia!' was the exclamation of Callum;
'assuredly the curse of the Red Priest is here!'
</p>

<p>
'Curse of&mdash;what do you say, my good man?' asked
the doctor, with a cross air of perplexity; 'it is the
result of an inward complaint under which she long
laboured.  She was highly susceptible&mdash;nervous&mdash;sickly
and sensitive&mdash;I was always quite prepared
for this fatal termination.'
</p>

<p>
'But you never said so till now,' retorted Callum;
'so what avails your skill.  Had she only kept <i>within</i>
the door she might have lived long enough.'
</p>

<p>
I now felt myself above the reach of further
misfortune.  I had been the mark of Fate's sharpest
arrows, and a proud but fierce emotion of defiance
swelled within me for a time.  Even Snaggs and the
coming terrors of the eviction were forgotten now.
Thus I felt buoyed up, as it were, by a courage
gathered from the very depth of my despair; but
anon, the sense of loneliness that fell upon me was
crushing and profound.
</p>

<p>
She who for years had watched over me, as only a
mother watches over the last of her little brood; she
who in age I had tended, nursed, and consoled, with
a love, like her own, the most unselfish and unwearied,
had died at last, when I was absent, and when
none was near to close her eyes&mdash;to kiss her pallid
lip.
</p>

<p>
'It is a warning!' exclaimed her old nurse Mhari.
'The men of Glentuirc are gone&mdash;those of Glen Ora
must soon follow.  Surd air Suinard! chaidh
Ardnamorchuan a doluidh!'[*]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
[*] "Prepare Sainard, for Ardnamorchuan is gone to wreck!"
a proverb.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Then came the funeral&mdash;all, all a dream to me.
</p>

<p>
The night had been dark and stormy, and in Glen
Ora the keening of the women, and the howling of the
dogs, 'who knew that death was nigh,' mingled with
the wail of the bagpipe and the soughing of the
wind; and, like a dream, I see before me still the
apartment hung with white, and all its furniture
shrouded in the same cold, dreary, livery; the coffin
lid bearing a vessel which contained a little salt, and
all the doors left wide open, to give free passage
to the departing spirit, which old superstition still
averred was hovering near its earthly tenement; the
low-moaned songs, or the deep and earnest
lamentations of Mhari, Minnie, and other women of the
glen; the cold, stiff, and conventional prayer by the
parish minister; the wine and whisky, cake and
cheese served round before 'the lifting,' and the
slow, solemn march of <i>Gil Chroisd</i> (the servant of
Christ), which Ewen Oig and Gillespie Ruadh wailed
forth on their great mountain-pipes, as they headed
the funeral procession, which departed about sunrise
for the burial-place of our tribe.
</p>

<p>
The morning dawned on murky clouds of red and
amber hue, piled in masses above Ben Ora, around
whose rocky crest the ascending mist was wreathed
like a mighty cymar.  The sun arose, but gloomy,
pale, and watery; and, to me, all nature seemed to
wear the livery of gloom and woe.
</p>

<p>
The day was as dreary as our errand was mournful,
and slowly the procession, which was formed by the
whole male population of the glen, in number about
a hundred men and boys, the aged supporting themselves
on their staffs, and leading their grandchildren
by the hand, wound over the hills, communing together
on the virtues of the deceased, and of that olden
time, to which a falling people ever look fondly back,
as a faded woman to the days of her beauty&mdash;as the
aged to the days of their youth.
</p>

<p>
All the funeral arrangements were conducted in
the modern, rather than the ancient, Highland fashion.
Old Sergeant Ian Mac Raonuil, who had served with
my father in the Black Watch, had the charge of
marshalling the procession, and at certain distances
on the road he regularly cried 'halt-relief,' when
four fresh men hastened forward to bear the coffin,
which was carried for four miles on the shoulders of
our people, until we reached the place of interment,
on the shore of a great salt loch, or arm of the sea.
</p>

<p>
The day was still lowering; the sounding sea of the
stormy Hebrides dashed its waves on the echoing
beach; the eternal mist, like a mighty shroud, rolled
along the drenched hills and dripping heather; and
through it, as through a veil, the joyless sun, shorn of
his rays, seemed at times to hang in mid air, like an
obscured lamp.  Our hearts were heavy indeed.
Even the Lowland Scots are peculiarly liable to be
impressed by the appearance of nature at all times;
then, at such a time of sorrow and foreboding, how
much more so were we, who were bred among the
stupendous scenery of the North, and by our race
and habits were the creatures of strong and gloomy
imaginations!  And then the slow, sad, and wailing
march of <i>Gil Chroisd</i>; how mournfully it rang between
the silent mountains, and woke the echoes of that
lonely shore, where the long-legged heron, or the
gigantic sea-horse, were brooding on the slippery
rocks, and where the wiry Scottish pines cast their
shadow on the breakers!
</p>

<p>
At a place named Coil-chro, or the Wood-of-hazel-nuts,
a turn of the path, as it wound over the headland,
brought us in view of a gentleman and two
ladies on horseback, attended by a smart mounted
servant, clad in a grey surtout, and accoutred with a
leather girdle, laced hat, and black cockade.  The
gentleman dismounted, and with much politeness
and good feeling, in imitation of the local custom,
remained on foot with head uncovered while the
procession passed by.  At a glance I recognized Captain
Clavering in this polite stranger, and under the broad
hats of the ladies the soft features of his bright-eyed
sister and the gentle Miss Everingham.  It was at
this moment that old Mac Raonuil cried 'halt-relief!'
and while a change took place in the bearers, Laura,
whose eyes were full of tears, brought her horse
close to me, and holding out her gloved hand, pressed
and patted mine with great frankness and kindly
sympathy.
</p>

<p>
'Heaven help you, poor Mr. Mac Innon,' she said;
'we all deplore your bereavement, and feel only
remorse and shame for the severity with which my
angry papa&mdash;&mdash;but what can <i>I</i> do?'
</p>

<p>
I kissed her hand, and she did not withdraw it;
while the beautiful expression that filled her eyes, to
which her half-drooping lids lent a wonderful
sweetness, made my heart swell with tenderness and
gratitude; for human sympathy was doubly valuable, and
hers was doubly dear to me at a time so terrible; but
again the shrill notes of the wild pipe struck up&mdash;again
the solemn procession went forward, and a turn
of the road hid Laura from my view&mdash;yet her eyes
seemed before me still, and her voice was lingering in
my car.
</p>

<p>
A half mile further on brought us to the ancient
burial-ground; it was circular and surrounded by a
low ruined wall of rough dry stones, as it had once
been a Druidical circle.  Here the grass grew with
peculiar richness and rankness, for the dead of more
than two thousand years lay there.  Old stones,
graven with quaint runes, lay half sunk, amid the
moss and nettles, like the Celtic cross that marked
where the Christianized Scot had laid his dust in the
same grave with his pagan fathers, who had worshipped
the God of Day and the Spirit of Loda.  Close
by stood an old chapel of the Kuldei, dedicated to
St. Colme, the Abbot of Iona.  It had been a ruin
since the Spaniards, under the loyal and noble
Marquis of Tullibardine, had landed in Glensheil, and
fought the Government troops early in the last
century; but a vaulted corner of this venerable fane was
still used as a chapel by the poor Catholic Gael of the
district.  Here a rough deal table served them for an
altar; a rough crucifix, and six candles, in clay
holders, stood thereon, with a few garlands of freshly-gathered
wild flowers, while heather was spread before
it for those who chose to kneel.  Near it was a
miserable hut, or wigwam, where Father Raoul Beg Mac
Donuil (<i>i.e.</i>, Little Father Ronald, the son of Donald),
a priest from the Scottish College at Valladolid,
dwelt in prayer, penury, and misery; for among the
poor clansmen of the impoverished and almost
desolate West, the labours of the Catholic clergy are
indeed the labour of love and self-denial.
</p>

<p>
Three Mac Innons had been Abbots of Iona, and
one of them built this chapel.  In ancient times,
when one of the house of Glen Ora died, a grave
was found in the morning ready dug; but by whose
hands no mortal knew&mdash;for none had ever dared to
watch so said old tradition; but even this mysterious
sexton had left the country, unable perhaps, as
Callum Dhu affirmed, to breathe the air that was
infected by factors, gangers, and rural police.
</p>

<p>
Before entering the burying-ground we performed
the deasuil, and went round it <i>with the sun</i>.  The people
insisted on this, and I had no wish or will but theirs;
besides, the Celt is a great stickler for ancient
customs.  The parish minister permitted Father Raoul
to say a prayer at the grave, for she who was gone
had ever been kind to him, as a priest of that faith
in which her forefathers had lived and died; and it
is a noble feature in the Highland character, that
neither priestcraft, rancour, nor bigotry could ever
warp or sever the kindly ties of blood and clanship.
</p>

<p>
The Place of Sleep, or, as some still named it as
in the Druid days, The Place of the Stones, was one of
those old yew-shaded graveyards which still remain
in many a desolate glen, to mark where our expatriated
people were wont to lay their dead.  Here we
lowered her into the narrow house.
</p>

<p>
A little shovelling, a little batting of sods, every
stroke on which went home to my aching heart, an
uncovering of heads&mdash;a little time, and all was over.
I felt more than ever alone in the world&mdash;for a
recollection was all that remained to me of my mother&mdash;my
last relative on this side of that remorseless
grave.
</p>

<p>
The minister patted me on the shoulder&mdash;the old
priest shook me kindly by the hand, and led me
away.  In vain did they tell me, in hackneyed phrase,
that those whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth; my
rebellious spirit spurned the stereotyped idea.  I felt
myself a beggar and a lonely outcast&mdash;that all was
over now, that every human tie which bound me to
my home (but had I now a home?) was torn asunder
for ever!
</p>

<p>
Omens of evil, such as serve to feed the superstitious
mind, and to make a deep impression on a
people so filled with poetry and wild fancies as our
unlettered Gael, had not been wanting, as forerunners
of these calamities; and these omens had been duly
remarked by the aged dwellers in our glen, as the
sure forerunners of direful events.
</p>

<p>
In the preceding winter, when the country was
covered by snow, Gillespie Ruadh and others
averred, that early one morning they discovered
marks of the feet or talons of a gigantic bird, each
impression being at least twenty yards apart.  These
tremendous footmarks were traced across the glen,
and over Ben Ora, from the loch to the sea shore,
where all trace of them was lost in the flowing tide.
On hearing of this marvel, I hurried to the spot, but
a fresh fall of snow had obliterated these strange
marks, which were declared to indicate a departure
of our people towards the western sea.
</p>

<p>
Moreover of late, the white stag had been frequently
seen, and had even ventured to approach the lights
in our cottage windows.
</p>

<p>
This animal, which the most expert of our foresters
had failed to slay, was a tall, powerful, and gigantic
stag, with antlers of remarkable size and beauty&mdash;royal
antlers&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> having three points on each horn.
These proud appendages it <i>never</i> cast; at least none
had ever been found.  According to the unvarying
story of the hunters, stalkers, and keepers, it was
known to have been in existence for more than two
hundred and fifty years; for Lachlan Mohr's father,
Torquil Mac Innon, who was slain by an arrow at
the battle of Benrinnes (excuse this antiquarianism,
good reader, but your Welshmen, Celts and Irishmen,
are full of such old memories), wounded it in the
right ear, the half of which he shot away.  Thereafter
a fleet and fierce, but stately white stag, minus an
ear, had roved, and was now affirmed to be roving, in
the woods of Glen Ora.
</p>

<p>
If this was indeed the same that Torquil covered
with his long Spanish arquebus, it must have rivalled
those of Juvenal, or the hawks of Ælian, which lived
for seven hundred years.  Be this as it may, if on the
shores of Lochtreig there was a white stag which
never died, why should there not be another on the
shores of Loch Ora? this was deemed unanswerable.
</p>

<p>
The swift white stag which now haunted the
woods of the Mac Innons was certainly (as I had
often seen by my telescope) minus the ear which
tradition alleged old Torquil shot away; and this
miraculous animal was affirmed to be the same which
had passed the tent of Lachlan in the night before he
was slain at Worcester, and which appeared before
the calamities of Culloden.  It had been visible often
of late, and the poor unlettered Gael of the glen
spoke of it in whispers one to another as a certain
warning of the total ruin about to overtake them.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
THE EVICTION.
</h3>

<p>
Whispering of these things, the men of the glen
recrossed the mountains, but slowly and silently, for
the voice of the pipe was heard no more on the
gloomy heath; the boom of the climbing waves had
died away on the distant beach, and evening was
reddening the dun heathy slopes of the Ben when
we drew near our home, and a cry of alarm burst
from those who were in front of our funeral party.
Large columns of smoke were seen to ascend from
the hollow, and to curl in the clear air between us
and the sky.
</p>

<p>
A chill came over the hearts of those who accompanied
me.  As for myself, I deemed, as I have said,
that misfortune had shot the sharpest shafts at me,
and now that I had nothing more in this world to
care for, or to fear; but yet I felt a sore pang, when,
on arriving at a gorge of the hills, rightly named
Gar-choine, or The Place of Lamentation, for there
the Campbells had once defeated the Mac Innons,
we came in sight of the beautiful natural amphitheatre
of Glen Ora, and saw thirty columns of smoke ascending
from as many cottages, and uniting in one broad
and heavy cloud of vapour, that rolled like mist along
the mountain sides.  On the slope of the hill were
clustered a crowd of women and children, screaming
and lamenting, while at the far extremity of the glen,
where the narrow and winding road that led to
Inverness dipped down towards the Caledonian
Canal, we perceived a train of carts laden with
furniture&mdash;the miserable household gear of our poor
cotters; while the bayonets of a party of soldiers who
escorted it&mdash;like a Spanish treasure or a Roman
triumph&mdash;flashed a farewell ray in the setting sun,
for resistance had been anticipated by Mr. Ephraim
Snaggs; and thus he had borrowed an unwilling party
from the detachment which usually garrisons the
secluded barrack at Fort William.
</p>

<p>
The glensmen paused on the brow of the hill
which overlooked their desecrated homes, and their
voices rose with their clenched hands in one heavy
and terrible imprecation; then with a shout they
rushed down towards their wives and little ones,
where a fresh scene of grief and sorrow awaited
them; for now we were homeless, and 'landless,
landless,' as ever were the race of Alpine in the last
century.
</p>

<p>
Snaggs and the Sheriff had taken their measures
well to evict the people, destroy their dwellings, and
seize the furniture when no resistance could be
offered; by choosing a time when all the men of the
glen were absent at my mother's interment.  Yet
they took nearly as many precautions before venturing
up the side of the Loch Ora, as if the clans were
still in their most palmy days, when Lachlan Mohr
feasted his brave men on the best beeves of the
Campbells, and had five hundred targets, and as
many claymores, hung in his hall.
</p>

<p>
The barbarous cruelties exercised by a neighbouring
Duchess and a canting Marquis upon the poor,
had so greatly exasperated the Mac Innons, that at
fairs and elsewhere, they had been in the habit of
openly threatening an armed resistance to any attempt
to evict them from the glen, where they&mdash;the
aboriginal race&mdash;had dwelt for ages before Laird or Peer
or feudal parchments had a name in the land.
Callum's character and mine were well known to be
reckless, bold, and even desperate; thus Messieurs
Snaggs and Mac Fee took their measures wisely, and
accordingly selected the time for attack, when the
whole of the male population were at the grave of
the Mac Innons.
</p>

<p>
The rural police of the adjacent districts were
secretly ordered to hold tryst in a wood about six
miles distant.  There they arrived about midnight,
and received a harangue from Sheriff Mac Fee on
the majesty of the law; there an oath was administered
to them, and there Mr. Snaggs quoted Blair,
and gave them that which proved much more
acceptable&mdash;a jorum of whisky and ale.  On mustering
their forces, these worthy officials found that, including
themselves, the Procurator Fiscal and a couple of
clerks, with the police, they had only thirty men,
but as well armed with hatchets, crow-bars, levers
and pickaxes, as if they were about to invest the
Redan.  Doubtful still of success, application had
been made to the Commandant at Fort William for a
Serjeant's party of twelve men from the Irish Fusileers,
with twenty rounds of ball-cartridge each, as
there was a fear that the same rifles which had done
such wonders at the recent Gathering, might cover
the legal person of the great moralist.  Thus the
whole <i>possé</i> marched in array of battle into the glen,
where, to the terror and dismay of the women, they
appeared about half an hour after the last of the
funeral procession had disappeared over the summit
of the hill.
</p>

<p>
An immediate and indiscriminate attack was made
upon the cottages and on the old jointure-house;
and amid the shrieks, outcries, tears and lamentations
of the women, the usual work of eviction and
destruction progressed with as much spirit as if Huske,
Hawley, Cumberland and Co., had left the infernal
shades to visit upper air.  Delay and mercy were
craved alike in vain by these poor people.  In vain
did more than one young mother hold her new-born
babe aloft; in vain did the daughters of those who
fought with Moore and Wellington, implore pity, on
bended knees, with clasped hands and streaming eyes,
as they clung about the knees of Snaggs and Mac
Fee; but each was "sullen as Ajax," and bent on
upholding the dignity of the law and of wealth.  The
inmates were summoned to come forth, and if they
refused, were roughly dragged out, some with babes
at their breasts, and batoned with such brutality, that
the Irish Fusileers, whose hearts revolted at the
police, and who in their own land had seen too much
of similar work, used the butts of their muskets
against the limbs of the law, and thus offered some
protection to our women.
</p>

<p>
Every article of furniture was flung out; box-beds
were torn down; chairs, tables, kail-pots, and kettles,
spinning-wheels, caups, quaighs and luggies, clothing
and delft, were thrown on the sward, and in many
instances destroyed in a spirit of sheer recklessness.
Every little object which time, tenderness, or
association made valuable in the humble eyes of the
cottagers was demolished or carried off.  The domestic
shrine was rifled; its <i>lares</i> desecrated&mdash;its household
gods destroyed.  Everything eatable or drinkable
was at once appropriated by the plunderers.  The
thatch was torn down; crow-bars and levers were
applied to the huge boulder-stones, which in many
instances formed the corners of the poor huts, and
by one or two wrenches, the whole fabric was
tumbled in a heap of ruin.  The cabers and couples were
cut through by saws or axes; and thus every hut,
house, barn, stable, and hen-roost were destroyed.
The old jointure-house was gutted of its furniture,
every vestige of which was piled on carts with the
miserable chattels of the people, and driven off
towards the nearest market-town; not an article of my
property escaped, save a few old seals and rings,
which, with my father's sword, old Mhari and Minnie
concealed about their persons.  Then the mansion
was unroofed; the doors hewn down; the windows
dashed out; and the floors torn up and burned, to
render it totally uninhabitable.  Thus from house to
house, from cot to cot, and from barn to byre, went
these ministers of destruction; the sick were dragged
from their beds; the aged mother of Alisdair Mac
Gouran, a woman in her ninetieth year, and whose
grey head had not left her pillow for three years, was
borne out and flung on the damp hill side.  Women
scarcely recovered from the pains of maternity&mdash;and
others on the point of becoming mothers, were alike
brought forth, and those who resisted, or vainly
attempted to save some prized article, though of little
value, were beaten with batons until forced to
relinquish their hold.
</p>

<p>
Seated by her fire, Widow Gillian (the relict of a
soldier whose patronymic was Ca-Dearg), and who
was the mother of three sons in our Highland Division,
boldly refused to come forth, or to yield up her
husband's silver medals, of which they endeavoured
to deprive her.  Rendered desperate and frantic, this
woman, though aged, seemed stout and active; she
clung, shrieking, to the posts of her bed; but the
police tore her away.  Then she caught wildly at the
jambs of a door; but her fingers were soon bruised or
broken by batons, and one constable tired of her
screaming, dealt her a blow which fractured her skull,
and covered her long grey hair with blood.  Then
she became insensible.  Flora, her daughter, one of
the prettiest girls in the glen, when seeking to defend
her, received a kick in the breast, from which she
never recovered.
</p>

<p>
Fire was now applied to all the remaining cottages,
and their roofs of thatch, turf, and heather,
with their old dry rafters of resinous mountain pine,
burned bravely.  The work of destruction was nearly
complete.
</p>

<p>
Then the sheriff mounted his horse; Snaggs bestrode
his trotting garron; the carts laden with such
furniture as had not been burned, broken, or deemed
worthless, were put in motion; the few sheep and
cattle of the people were collected, and accompanied
by the constables who were laden with everything
they could lay hands upon, and surrounded by the
pitying soldiers with their bayonets fixed,
Messrs. Fungus Mac Fee, Ephraim Snaggs, and the Fiscal,
headed the plunder of the glen, and departed, leaving
that once beautiful little mountain-village a heap of
smoking ruins&mdash;every hut levelled flat, or sinking
amid smoke, flame, and dust&mdash;the jointure-house
reduced to four bare walls; while the women and
their little ones, bathed in tears, or covered with cuts,
blood, and bruises, remained in a stupor of silent
astonishment and horror at this irreparable destruction,
which divested them of shelter, of food, furniture,
clothing, and everything, and just when the
rain-charged clouds of night were descending on the
hills.
</p>

<p>
Let not the English reader deem this atrocious
scene overdrawn.  In Sutherland, Inverness, and
Ross, in Moidart and the Isles, such have been
enacted with even greater brutality since the beginning
of this century.  Yet the brave, hardy, frugal and
patient Highlanders have endured it without
complaint.  In form of law, murders have been committed
in open day&mdash;but then it was merely the manslaughter
of a few Highland paupers, to enforce the
dignity of ducal wealth and the majesty of feudal law.
</p>

<p>
'Thus it is,' says the brave old General Stewart,
'that the love of speculating in the brute creation,
has invaded these mountains, into which no foreign
enemy could ever penetrate, and has expelled a brave
people whom no invader could ever subdue.  It has
converted whole glens and districts, once the abode
of a bold, vigorous, and independent race of men, into
scenes of desolation.'
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap20"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
DESOLATION.
</h3>

<p>
Night came down on that scene of lamentation and
woe&mdash;on more than eighty human beings who were
fashioned in the image of God, and were yet denied
such shelter as He accords to the fox and eagle; but
though their hearths were desolate, and their old
hereditary but humble homes demolished, the clearance
could not be deemed complete, until the people
were entirely swept away from the country.
</p>

<p>
Callum and I obtained shelter with the old priest
Father Raoul, who afforded us a corner of his little
hut; the poor man had but one pallet&mdash;and there we
remained for a day or two, considering what steps
should be taken to find food for those who were
starving in the now desolate glen, and moreover to
provide for ourselves.
</p>

<p>
Thus I found a temporary home, within a few feet
of the spot, where she, to whom I had ever turned for
consolation and comfort, advice and sympathy, was
taking her eternal rest.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile fresh cruelties and scenes of horror
took place in that ill-fated glen, where the people
were completely given up to the malevolent fury of
Snaggs, who, as a man of the law, had a truly legal
aversion to Highlanders.
</p>

<p>
The evicted formed a little bivouac on the heather.
In one place lay a sick mother, stretched on a pallet,
covered by her husband's plaid; around her nestled
her little ones, gazing with awe and terror at this
unusual scene; on the deathlike visage of one parent
and the stern despair that lurked in the eyes of the
other.  Fires of turf and rafters were kindled, and
round these, in little booths of rugs and plaids,
nestled the younger children, and infants in cradles.
Amid these the elder children sported and played,
ignorant of the ruin that had come upon them, and in
their heedless glee forming a strong contrast to their
grief-stricken parents, whose once high spirit was
crushed and broken now.  Such is the effect of
tyranny, starvation, and misrule!
</p>

<p>
The old soldier, Ian Mac Raonuil, burrowed a hole
on the brow of a hill under a rock, and spread his
plaid over it.  Herein lay his wife, nursing a sickly
and delicate child, while he with his stouter sons
slept on the sward.  The air became chilly, and the
cloudy sky was overcharged with dew; thus many
who were sick and ailing, wandered about like ghosts
on the midnight hill, unable to find either shelter or
repose.  Premature labour came on the wife of
Gillespie Ruadh; and there, on the bleak side of Ben
Ora, the wretched Highland mother brought her child
into the world.  Before morning she expired, and the
aged widow Mac Gouran lay also a corpse, not far
from her; for before dawn, there came on a tempest
of lightning, wind, and rain, as if the very elements
had conspired with the petty tyrants of the glen, to
destroy the homeless Mac Innons.  And while the
blue lightning gleamed between the bare scalp of Ben
Ora and the rifted brow of the Craig-na-tuirc; while
the rain like a ceaseless torrent smoked along the
soaking heather, and flooded every rocky chasm and
sandy runnel; while the wind swept over the hills as
if it would have torn up the heath by the roots, our
poor people all nestled together, and, lifting up their
voices, sang a psalm with touching piety.  Amid this
tempest the mother and her youngling died; and the
beautiful Celtic superstition&mdash;that a woman who dies
in childbed, whatever her offences in life&mdash;is borne
by angels straight to heaven, was remembered now,
as the people whispered it to one another, and drew
comfort from it.
</p>

<p>
The sufferings of the night left them more wretched
than ever.
</p>

<p>
To shelter the women, and to veil the dead bodies
from the view of the children, a few cabers were
propped together, and above these the men spread
their plaids and grey frieze coats; but ere long there
was a cry of alarm, and the infamous Snaggs, with a
party of his levellers and armed constables, came upon
them again.  Then the coverings were torn off; the
cabers flung aside, and the sick and the dead were
remorselessly exposed to the blaze of the hot morning
sun.  The booth which sheltered the children was
demolished, and the wife of Mac Raonuil was dragged
from her hole on the hill-side.
</p>

<p>
In vain did she weep and hold up her babe; in
vain did the sick veteran, her husband, point to his
wounded arm, his silver hairs, and three war-medals;
the only reply was fierce abuse for daring to seek
shelter, or to burrow, after a notice of removal had
been duly served upon them.
</p>

<p>
A few ducks and hens, which had been wandering
and scraping among the ruins of the cottages, were
now collected and carried off by the constables, lest
they might afford a day's food to the homeless, who
were threatened with fresh vengeance by those
jacks-in-office, if found in the glen to-morrow.  Mr. Snaggs,
who always spoke blandly, quoted Scripture and
Blair on the folly of resistance; the beauty of
submission to the will of God, and more especially of the
new proprietor, for 'go they must&mdash;a ship was coming
round to Loch Ora with sheep; and on the morrow
there would arrive several hampers of a new species
of game with which Sir Horace meant to stock the
glen.  Go then, my dear friends,' continued
Mr. Snaggs, with a gloating eye at Minnie, who was
kneeling over some sick children; 'go, and the Lord
will provide for you in Canada&mdash;"for," as the divine
Blair says, "neither obscurity of station, nor
imperfection of knowledge sink below his regard those who
obey and worship him."'
</p>

<p>
With this trite quotation, the elder and the factor
whipped up his pony, and departed with a couple of
fat ducks dangling at its saddle-bow.
</p>

<p>
Next morning, the keepers arrived with their hampers
of game on a cart, and as they entered the glen
by the lower pass, the original inhabitants retired by
the upper, (bearing their dead, their dying, the sick,
aged, and little ones, slung in plaids over the
shoulders of the stoutest men,) towards the only
shelter that remained to them&mdash;and assuredly the last
which the Gael would think of adopting&mdash;the old
ruined chapel of St. Colme upon the sea-beaten rocks
of the western coast, for, as no Highland landlord
will allow the evicted tenants of another to tarry
within his bounds, the graveyards alone are now the
neutral ground.  There among the tombs they formed
a new bivouac above the long rank grass that
wrapped their fathers' dust.  Close by were the
moss-covered and lichen-spotted ruins of the old chapel,
where the owl and the bat had their nests, and where
the sombre ivy grew in luxuriance&mdash;a place of many
solemn memories and many legendary terrors.
</p>

<p>
Location of every kind was refused by the adjacent
proprietors; so with a vast tract of wild and rugged
mountains and pathless hunting forests around them,
our people were compelled to herd like cattle within
the circular wall of the burying-ground; for most of
the modern tyrants of the North share alike the love
of game, the lust of gold, and a horror of the Celtic
race.
</p>

<p>
It was on the fourth day that the widow of the
Ca-Dearg (whose head had been fractured by the blow
of a baton) died; and a cry for vengeance against her
murderers went up to heaven from the denizens of
that uncouth bivouac, as they committed her body to
the earth; and it was fortunate that all the rifles and
weapons of the people had been seized; for in
Callum's breast and mine, there swelled up such a
glow of fury, that we would assuredly have committed
some fierce and retributive act, at which all Britain
would have been startled.
</p>

<p>
'Are we slaves?' exclaimed Callum, furiously; 'I
speak in English, Mac Innon; for, thank heaven, the
Gaelic is the <i>only</i> language in the world that has no
word expressive of slavery.'
</p>

<p>
'A bootless boast,' said I, gloomily; 'and what
matters it, when we may be murdered with
impunity?'
</p>

<p>
'Evil has come upon us like snow upon the mountains,
unsought and unsent for,' said he, as we closed
the grave of the soldier's widow; 'poor old woman!
Her blood has been shed by a staff that bore the royal
crown and cypher&mdash;and for that crown her three brave
sons are fighting in the East.  A chial! a Highland
soldier, or a Highland soldier's mother, are of less
value than a grouse or plover&mdash;a sheep or a cow;
for they cannot be shot for pleasure like the former,
nor fattened to feed the southern market like the
latter; and it is for a Government that treats us thus
our soldiers fight and die!  <i>Is samhach an obair dol a
dholaidh!</i>'
</p>

<p>
'Alas, yes&mdash;silent is the progress of ruin!' I
replied, repeating the proverb; 'but had our glen been
in Tipperary, at what premium would the lives of
Snaggs and Sir Horace been insured?'
</p>

<p>
'Sir Horace has driven us forth, that our glen may
be peopled by wild animals; <i>but if fire will burn</i>, by the
five wounds of God, and by the Black Stone of Scone,
he will make little of that!' swore Callum, in a
hoarse Gaelic whisper.
</p>

<p>
There was a dark and savage gleam in his hazel
eyes as he spoke; and though aware that he referred
to a project of vengeance, I cared not then to ask
what it was.
</p>

<p>
Old Mhari was the wise woman and chief adviser
and mediciner of the glen; she placed implicit
belief in a hundred charms, spells, traditions, and
absurdities that have come down to us through long
and misty ages&mdash;yea, since the days of Fingal; for
the supernatural is full of charms to the mind of a
mountaineer.  Thus Mhari was the custodier of one
of those sanctified girdles which were usually kept in
many Highland families, and which were bound about
women in childbed.  They were impressed with
strange and mystic figures; and the ceremony of
binding was accompanied by words of Druidical
origin; but Mhari was sorely perplexed and bewildered
when the wife of Gillespie Ruadh expired amid
the tempest, with this ancient girdle of maternity
around her.
</p>

<p>
In a revengeful spirit, that bordered on the necromantic
malevolence of the olden time, she fashioned
an image of clay, which she named 'Ephraim Snaggs,'
and selecting a time when the moon was full, placed
it in a runnel which distilled between the rocks from
a lonely tarn, among the sedges of which the dusky
water-ouzel laid its eggs, and where the lazy bittern,
whose croak forebodes a storm, made its home; and
she believed that as the stream washed away the clay,
and reduced it to a shapeless mass, and from thence
to mere mud, so would the ungainly person of
Mr. Ephraim Snaggs waste, pine, and decay: but most
unfortunately, and greatly to the injury of Mhari's
local reputation, this incantation of the nineteenth
century turned out a complete failure; for though
the runnel washed away the image in less than three
days, Snaggs remained unharmed and well as ever;
for we frequently saw him trotting his pony along
the mountain path which led to the house of Sir
Horace Everingham.
</p>

<p>
Though supported by the secret charity of the
neighbouring clachans, our poor people were
meanwhile enduring great misery.  Their nights were
passed shelterless among the dreary shades of the
dead&mdash;each mother with her children clinging round
her in terror and hunger; for their principal
sustenance had been herbs, mountain-berries, and cold
water.
</p>

<p>
Each morning they thanked God that another night
was past; and each night they thanked Him for the
sorrowful day that was gone.  The wind whistled
drearily from the ocean round the open ruins, and
over the long grassy graves, and bare, bleak headland
of St. Colme.  It seemed to bear on its breath a
wailing sound, like a dirge of the dying, as it swept
through the old yew-trees&mdash;but this, of course, was
fancy.
</p>

<p>
With a heart that vibrated between love and
hatred, anger and sorrow, I thought of Laura Everingham.
</p>

<p>
If the regret she expressed so prettily and so pithily
for her father's previous severity and his Victor's
cruelty was sincere, what would her emotions be
now?
</p>

<p>
But days passed away, and no message from her
ever reached me at that wretched hut, which the
poor but hospitable priest had invited me to share.
This neglect stung me to the soul, and caused an
anger that not even the memory of Laura's winning
kindness, the strange admissions of Snobleigh in the
avenue, and the memory of her soft smile or the
beauty of her person could subdue; but I knew not
that during this, our time of calamity, she and Fanny
Clavering were paying a visit to a noble marquis,
whose exterminating propensities have made him
famous as one of the chief '<i>Barriers</i> to the prosperity
of Scotland.'
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Sir Horace, Sheriff Mac Fee, and
Mr. Snaggs, after a voluminous correspondence with the
Board of Supervision, had a steamer despatched to
Loch Ora, to convey our people to Glasgow, where
(without being landed) they were to be thrust like
slaves on board of a vessel bound for America.  Their
final expatriation was fully resolved on by the trio;
and none of the evicted were consulted either as to
their wishes or destination, as they were alleged to
be poor and ignorant Celts, who knew no language
but their native Gaelic, and were helpless and stricken
alike by poverty, sickness, and a wholesome terror of
the powers that be.
</p>

<p>
The night was pitchy dark and somewhat stormy,
when our poor outcasts saw the steamer that was to
convey them for ever from their loved Highland
home, ploughing the lonely waters of the deep salt
loch that opened into the mountains; and a wail of
despair ascended from the bleak burial promontory,
as they heard the roar of the escaping steam, and the
plunge of the descending anchor, when the vessel
came to her moorings.  Then the red light at her
mast-head was watched for hours by the doomed and
expatriated clansmen with emotions which no pen
can describe, or pencil portray.
</p>

<p>
On this night it was averred that the <i>white stag</i> had
been seen to hover near us in the gloom.
</p>

<p>
Low down along the base of Ben Ora, round the
shore of the mirrored loch, and in the dark glen they
had left, our people saw a wondrous blaze of light
that illuminated the sky&mdash;that tinged the clouds with
wavering fire, and lit the cold grey rocks and hills&mdash;the
waving woods, and ghastly corries.  It widened
and grew on every hand, that marvellous sheet of
flame, seeming to embrace the whole country in its
fiery grasp; and with shouts of fear and wonder, the
poor people, while gazing on this phenomenon, forgot
for a time their own sorrows, and the approaching
hour of their final expatriation.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><br />
THE HEATHER ON FIRE!
</h3>

<p>
On this night Callum and I were loitering in the
glen, among the ruins of our once-peaceful and
contented mountain hamlet; but oppressed by sadness,
on witnessing the new desolation of the place, we
wandered three or four miles away, and there older
scenes of barbarity awaited us.
</p>

<p>
We sat down on some piles of stones that were half
shrouded by the rising dog-grass, the moss, and the
long feathery bracken.  These marked the site of a
few huts.  Here once dwelt a brave little community
named the Mac Ellars, one of whom had been my
tutor, and here I had attended his little school,
bringing each day with me, like other boys, a peat, as a
contribution to his fire; for this is the old Highland
custom, and the urchin who failed to do so was denied
the privilege of warming his kilted legs for that
day.  Here often had I played the truant, and been
threatened by my mother with <i>the Druid</i>&mdash;that
venerable bugbear of the Highland urchin.
</p>

<p>
The Mac Ellars were all brave and hardy men,
whose progenitors had occupied their 'holdings'
since the days of Lachlan Mohr; and it was with
them that Callum made the famous riot in Glen Ora,
when burning the effigies of a certain English historian,
and his miserable Scottish imitator, for their
falsehoods and absurd antipathy to the clansmen and
their national characteristics.  But the youth of the
clachan, twelve sturdy young lads, had been cajoled by
a noble marquis and the duchess, his mother, into the
ranks of the Sutherland Highlanders, and had marched
to fight the Russians: <i>then</i> their cottages were levelled,
and their aged parents were driven forth to beg, to
starve, or die&mdash;tidings, no doubt, but ill-calculated to
rouse the patriotism or fan the <i>amor patriæ</i> of the poor
Celtic soldier, when chewing his green coffee in the
frozen trenches of Sebastopol, or sinking under
disease, with other victims of treachery and mismanagement,
in the frightful hospital at Scutari; but
fortunately for our Government, the poor clansman
is animated by a love of home, which neither time
can efface nor tyranny destroy.  Thus were the Mac
Ellars rooted out&mdash;the young sent to storm
Sebastopol&mdash;the old to starve in the Lowlands, while the
marquis and his <i>passé</i> mother were in a state of fervid
Uncle Tommery, and, inspired by Mrs. Stowe's romance,
were the leaders and patrons of anti-slavery
meetings in the South, and fustian addresses to the
women of America.
</p>

<p>
The ruined cottages which are met with at every
few miles, amid the depopulated portions of our
Highlands, dotting those vast glens which are silent
and voiceless now as the most savage wilds of
Hudson's Bay, or the great desert of Zahara, are well
calculated to excite emotions of melancholy, as being
the last relics of an old and departed race.
</p>

<p>
The wild gooseberry-bushes straggling among the
stones; the old well, half choked by sand or weeds;
the half-flattened fences; the garden-flowers growing
rank among the encroaching heather, all told us the
visual melancholy tale; and Callum and I sat in
silence on the mossy stones, watching the daylight
dying away beyond the distant sea, and full of our
own sad and bitter thoughts.
</p>

<p>
He seemed wholly intent on polishing the butt of
a steel Highland pistol, and while he did so, there
hovered a dark and sombre aspect of ferocity on his
brow.
</p>

<p>
We were silent, I have said, for both were too
much oppressed to speak.  Suddenly a black cock
appeared on a fragment of rock near us, and clapped
his wings as if in defiance.  Quick as lightning
Callum levelled the pistol and shot him dead; a
moment the outstpread pinions beat the heather,
and then lay still, while the pistol-shot was pealing
among the echoes of the wilderness.  My fosterer
leisurely reloaded and brought the bird to me; it
was large, weighing more than five pounds, its sable
plumage glazed all over with a shining blue, and its
stomach gorged with bilberries.
</p>

<p>
'I hope the report may not reach the ear of some
rascally keeper,' said I, throwing a hasty glance
about me; 'if so, we shall be accused of poaching.
It was a risk, Callum, to shoot that bird just now.'
</p>

<p>
'It is the last shot I may ever have on a Highland
mountain,' said Callum Dhu, with a fierce sigh;
'and with little regret would I have put the same
ball into the fat brisket of Sir Horace himself, if he
stood within twelve paces of me, on this red heather
to-night.'
</p>

<p>
'For heaven's sake, Callum, do not speak thus,'
said I; 'Sir Horace is less to blame than his evil
mentor, Snaggs&mdash;I believe that in heart he is rather
amiable.'
</p>

<p>
'Listen, Co-dhalta!' retorted Callum, turning upon
me, and gazing with a full and angry frown.  'You
love this man's daughter, and I like it as little as the
good lady your mother (now, God rest her, in her
grave) would have done.  You love one who despises
you&mdash;and yet your blood is as red as any in Scotland!'
</p>

<p>
'She does not despise me!' I responded, almost
fiercely.
</p>

<p>
'Yet loving her is folly.'
</p>

<p>
'A folly that makes me happy.'
</p>

<p>
'A folly that makes you miserable!  Will you
remember her only as the daughter of one who has the
lives of Gillespie's wife and child, and of the widow
of the Oa-Dearg to answer for?'
</p>

<p>
'Sir Horace is no worse than the canting Marquis,
or a hundred other proprietors in the North.'
</p>

<p>
'That is saying but little&mdash;there are many great
men in Scotland still, deserving the dagger of
Kirkpatrick and the bullet of Bothwellhaugh&mdash;and great
is the pity that such pretty things have gone out of
fashion.  The best tune Rory Dall ever played men
will tire of; and so I am tired of this Lowlander's
tyranny.'
</p>

<p>
'He is no Lowlander, Callum,' said I, anxiously
observing the fierce expression of my companion.
</p>

<p>
'He is an Englishman, which is almost as bad.'
</p>

<p>
I burst into a fit of laughter at this remark.
</p>

<p>
'Ah&mdash;you laugh,' said Callum, grimly; 'let us
see whose laugh will be loudest to-morrow.  He has
cleared the glen of men to make way for game&mdash;let
us see what he will gain by that&mdash;the club-footed
ouzel.'
</p>

<p>
'How?' I asked, glancing in alarm at the pistol
on which he was carefully placing a percussion cap.
</p>

<p>
'This very night I shall fire the heather.'
</p>

<p>
'For heaven's sake, Callum,' said I, 'beware what
you do; for the consequent destruction of life and
property may be terrible.'
</p>

<p>
'I care not&mdash;these lords and holiday-chiefs are
destroying the people&mdash;<i>let the people destroy the game that
brings them gold</i>.  I will fire the heather, I tell you!'
he added, in a fierce Gaelic whisper; 'by that blessed
star which led the wise men to the cradle of God, I
have sworn to do so, and it shall be done, come of it
what may!'
</p>

<p>
I was about to speak again, when the clatter of
hoofs rang on the mountain-path, and Mr. Snaggs
passed us on his shaggy-coated cob.  Anger swelled
my breast on seeing him; but he bowed to us with
an ironical smile, and we saw&mdash;or thought we saw&mdash;that
his eyes were brilliant with malice at the success
of that "ingenious ferocity" with which he had
extirpated the peasantry of the district.  He rode slowly
up the slope of the great Ben, and the outlines of his
ungainly figure and barrel-bellied charger appeared in
dark relief between us and the yellow flush that bathed
the western sky.
</p>

<p>
'What errand takes him to the Craig-na-tuirc to-night?'
I remarked.
</p>

<p>
'The devil only knows: perhaps to see the desolation
he has made, and whether any of our people have
lit a fire in the glens below.  There he goes&mdash;may evil
follow, and destruction dog him close! may the curse
of the poor on whom he tramples, and the scorn of the
rich whom he worships, be his lot!  I'll show them a
flame on Ben Ora to-night that will startle all the
Western Highlands!'
</p>

<p>
Callum drew forth his powder-horn, and after
casting a keen but furtive glance around him in the
dusk, and after seeing Mr. Snaggs fairly disappear in
a hollow of the hills, he shook out the contents, laying
across the narrow mouth of the glen a train on the
soft dry heather and its bed of turf and decayed moss
below.  Careless of the event, and now resigned to
whatever might follow, I observed him in moody
silence, and not without feeling within me that longing
for revenge which is so curiously mingled in the
Celtic nature, with a wild sense of justice and of injury.
</p>

<p>
'This is a crime against the law,' said I, in a low
voice, remembering that <i>muirburning</i> is a serious offence
in Scotland, and that the Acts passed by the Parliaments
of the first, third, fourth, and fifth Jameses
concerning it, are alike stringent and severe.
</p>

<p>
'Curse upon the laws,' grumbled Callum; 'if none
were made, they would never be violated,' and with
these words he emptied the last contents of his horn.
Again he looked round him.
</p>

<p>
The sun had set long since; the tints of the vast
mountain had turned from purple to black, and no
living thing seemed to be stirring in that intense
solitude.  Callum stooped, and fired his pistol at the
train.  The powder flashed, and rose like a fiery
serpent along the grass; the dry summer-moss, the
decayed leaves and dead ferns ignited like tinder, and
in a moment the thick heath and its bed of turf and
peat below were wrapped in smoke and flame&mdash;a
flame that spread on every hand, deepening and
extending, as it rolled, like a devouring and encroaching
tide, mounting up the sides of the glen before the
soft west wind that blew from the dark waves of the
salt lake.
</p>

<p>
Fiercely it crackled, smouldered, and burned, in
those places where the bracken or whins, the
burr-docks, brambles, rank weeds, and gorse grew thick;
but in others it rolled steadily on with great rapidity,
spreading and widening in the form of a vast
semi-circle, as if it would embrace the whole country in
its grasp.  As it mounted into the higher portions of
the landscape, and seized on the thickets of silver
birch and the resinous mountain-pine, the conflagration
began to crackle, roar, and hiss, and its flames to
shoot aloft and brighten against the sky like the
wavering beams of the Northern Lights, tinging the
clouds with pink and purple hues.
</p>

<p>
Now sheep and cattle, horses, rabbits, foxes, and
fuimarts, with herds of frantic deer, fled before the
flames; and screaming in their terror and confusion,
the muirfowl flew hither and thither, or hung
overhead among the vapour that shrouded the starry sky.
The scene was strange, wild, and terrible; the more
so that amid all this general alarm of nature there
was not heard the voice of man in wonder or in fear;
but the glens had been swept of their people, and
the beasts of the field and the birds of the air alone
remained.
</p>

<p>
With astonishment and somewhat of awe, I gazed
on this strange and striking scene, while Callum Dhu
surveyed it with a grim smile of triumph and derision
on his weather-beaten face, which was reddened by
the distant glow.
</p>

<p>
This was one of the most dreadful instances of
muirburning that ever occurred in Scotland: the
flames travelled at the rate of one hundred and fifty
yards a minute, and soon embraced a front of nearly
sixteen miles in length, being four miles more than
that tide of fire which lately devoured the moors of
Strathaven.
</p>

<p>
The whole of the muirlands&mdash;covered with short
dry summer heather, the thickets of fir and the game
preserves round the base of Ben Ora, from the mouth of
the glen where we sat to the deep dark gorge of
Garchoine, from the shore of the loch on the east to the
hazel wood of Coilchro on the west, where the narrow
path to St. Colme's chapel overhangs the foaming sea&mdash;a
semicircle, as I have said, of sixteen miles&mdash;were
sheeted in red and yellow flame.  Above the mighty
wreaths of smoke which rose from the blazing and
falling plantations, and from the remains of old
primeval forests, towered the huge mountain&mdash;the
monarch of the western hills&mdash;like a dark and
wonderous dome.  At its base lay the loch gleaming in
light, and seeming, in this nocturnal blaze, like a
mighty mirror zoned by the smoke and fire, which
gradually crept from the low districts upward to the
summit of the craigs and hills, where it played in
streaks of deep and fiery red, or flashed upward in
forky and lambent flames before it died away in
vapour.
</p>

<p>
In the deep and naked ravines, and those places
over which the fire had passed, sweeping like a
burning tide, the nests and lairs of the game, with every
trace of animal and vegetable life, passed away, leaving
only the bare black roots of the turf and heather,
while vast columns of smoke hung motionless, like
giants in mid-air as if the fires of the Day of Doom
had sent them forth; and through these murky
masses the broad round moon at times peered dimly
and darkly out, like Fingal's shield, half hidden and
half seen.
</p>

<p>
'Down, Mac Innon, down!' cried Callum, as a
herd of terrified deer came rushing like a living
torrent down a narrow ravine, which was threaded by a
mountain stream, up the margin of which we were
now ascending, as being the safest pathway through
this land of fire: 'Hoigh! look at Mac Gilonie's
dun cattle, how they come thundering down with the
sparks at their heels!'
</p>

<p>
These words were barely uttered, when the frantic
herd&mdash;three hundred and more&mdash;were upon us, with
all their branching antlers lashing the air; but as we
threw ourselves flat on our faces among the long
bracken and dog-grass, this four-footed tempest swept
lightly over us, and disappeared towards the seashore.
</p>

<p>
'There they go towards the Atlantic&mdash;dun deer
and red foxes, fat hares and long-eared rabbits,
fuimarts, otters, and everything!  By the blood that is
in us, Sir Horace, but it is mighty little shooting you
or yours will have hereabout for these some years to
come!  The people have gone towards the sea, and
your devilish game have followed them.  But see,'
added Callum; 'what is that&mdash;a man mounted on a
deer?'
</p>

<p>
'No, no&mdash;a pony.'
</p>

<p>
'How he gallops!  Dioul! my fine fellow, take
care of your neck.'
</p>

<p>
'It is Snaggs!' said I.
</p>

<p>
'Snaggs&mdash;and he rides like fury&mdash;up hill too! now
the pony falls&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'He is down!'
</p>

<p>
'Up again&mdash;on foot, and he runs like a sow possessed
by a devil towards the Craig-na-tuirc, with the
fire rolling at his heels,' said Callum, rubbing his
hands in fierce glee.
</p>

<p>
'Fire behind and a precipice in front.'
</p>

<p>
'Dioul&mdash;we are giving him claw for claw at last!'
</p>

<p>
'But we must save him, Callum&mdash;he will be
scorched to death or dashed to pieces.'
</p>

<p>
A fierce laugh was his only reply.  While all this
passed in less time than I have taken to record it, we
dashed along the stony ravine, guided by the rivulet,
and though half-blinded by smoke, reached the Ora,
which was there overhung by the Craig-na-tuirc.  At
that moment a wild and despairing cry for succour
rang in the air above us.
</p>

<p>
'Ay, bay to the moon, false wolf&mdash;but there are
few ears now in Glen Ora to hear you!' growled
Callum through his thick, rough beard, as we began
rapidly to clamber up the brow of the precipice, the
summit of which was shrouded by smoke, and streaked
with fire like the crater of a volcano.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><br />
THE UISC DHU.
</h3>

<p>
Hawks, gleds, and eagles, with a hundred birds of
other kinds, whose nests had been destroyed, were
screaming, as if in anger or surprise, and flapping
their wings about us, in the mid and murky air, as we
clambered up, and thrice the wild cry of the
despairing wretch tingled in my ears, before we reached
the summit, after a half-hour of arduous exertion.
</p>

<p>
There, on the giddy verge, a strange sight awaited
us.
</p>

<p>
Not far from the spot where Callum had rescued
Sir Horace Everingham, and at a place where the
steep rocky brow of the cliffs overhung the dark
chasm through which the foaming waters of the black
river bellowed, roared, and forced a passage towards
the sea, we saw the miserable factor Snaggs dangling
in mid-air like a crow, and clinging to the branches
of a tough but withered mountain-ash, and to its
stem, which&mdash;terrible to conceive!&mdash;projected over
this dark Cimmerian gulf.  Hemmed in on every side
by the encroaching fire, which ran at his heels, he
had been forced to retreat upward to the edge of the
rock, and though all unused to feats of strength or
agility, excess of terror had supplied him with both;
for when the flames assailed the thick coating of turf,
soft heather, and crackling whins which covered the
summit of the Craig, he was compelled to take refuge
in the branches of the mountain-ash, and to these he
clung, swinging above the dark vacuity below, with a
tenacity of clutch and a horror impossible to portray.
</p>

<p>
But now the same fire which had consumed the
tufted whins, the turf and heath, assailed the dry
roots of the ash which twined among them, and soon
the whole fabric of the tree was in a blaze; and as its
fibres crackled and relaxed their tough grasp of the
rocks and smouldering turf, the stem began to sink
and yield with its own weight, and the weight of the
fainting sinner who clung to it.
</p>

<p>
Such was the terrible tableau that awaited us on
reaching a ledge of rock close by it.
</p>

<p>
As seen by the fitful glimpses of the moon through
gauzy clouds and rolling smoke, the pale, white,
ghastly visage of Snaggs was appalling.  He still
shrieked for succour and for mercy, and his entreaties
were but a succession of shrill screams like those of a
girl.  His eyes glared; foam hung upon his lips, and
his tongue was parched and swollen.  I would have
hastened to proffer him assistance, but the strong
hands of Callum held me back by main force.
</p>

<p>
'Mercy to the merciless?' said he; 'nay&mdash;he shall
have such mercy as he gave the people of our
glens&mdash;such mercy as he would have given my poor Minnie
at the Clach-na-greiné.  He is a fiend&mdash;so let him die
a fiend's death!  Ha&mdash;ha!  Mr. Snaggs&mdash;the tree is
bending now; once it rose at the angle of forty-five,
now it is quite horizontal.  I wish every factor hung
on its branches like fruit for the devil.  Think of the
old widow of the Ca-Dearg, and her silver hair all
clotted in her blood; think of the cold, grey morning
that dawned on the wet mountain-side, when the
dying wife of the Red Gillespie lay with her new-born
babe, and expired without a shelter from the
blast!  Her babe is now where you can never be&mdash;for
it is among the flowers that are gathered in
heaven!  Think of the cruel advice you have given
this jolter-headed stranger&mdash;this Horace Everingham&mdash;whose
presence has been a curse to us.  Think of my
Minnie and the evil you intended for her.  Think of
all your hypocrisy, your legal quirks and quibbles,
and of all the villanies of your past life, for the root
of the tree burns bravely, and will not last a minute
more.  Ha! ha! ha!'
</p>

<p>
The love of life, the lust of gold, and the dread of
death and hell grew strong within the wretched soul
of Snaggs, and his aspect became frightful.  Matted
by perspiration, his hair clung about his temples, and
his eyes were starting from their sockets.  With all
the tenacity that love of existence, conflicting with an
awful fate, can impart to the sinews of a coward, he
clung to that withered ash, and swung wildly over
the hideous abyss, where the black water foamed two
hundred feet below.
</p>

<p>
Now his toes touched the brow of the rock, and
anon his feet would beat the empty air in vain!  The
flames played about the roots; the smoke almost
choked him, and slowly, gradually, fearfully the stem
continued to sink and to yield, as the knotty fibres
which so long had grasped the rocks were relinquishing
their hold at last.
</p>

<p>
'Mercy&mdash;mercy&mdash;mercy!' he shrieked.
</p>

<p>
'Such mercy as you gave the people in Glen Ora
and Glentuirc&mdash;such mercy as you have ever given
the poor and the trusting, I give you now&mdash;a tiger's
mercy!' replied Callum, still holding me back, though
it was physically impossible for me to have afforded
the least assistance to Snaggs, circumstanced as he
was then, and cut off from us by the flaming tree.
</p>

<p>
'God&mdash;God!' gasped the miserable wretch.
</p>

<p>
'Call not on Him, hypocrite, for even He may fail
one so steeped in wickedness as you.  Hear me&mdash;I
am Callum Dhu Mac Ian, on whom you have never
ceased to heap up insult, contumely, and contempt.
I am well and young, and strong, having, with God's
blessing, many years of life before me, while you are
now in the jaws of death.  You will go down into
the depth of that dark linn like a stone, Mr. Snaggs;
a splash, a bubble, and all will be over!  One sinner
more will have gone to his awful account&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Mercy!' he croaked.
</p>

<p>
The tree was still burning and bending!
</p>

<p>
'A time will come, a week, a month, a season
perhaps, and the deep waters of Loch Ora will give up
the ghastly dead.  A corpse, swollen, hideous and
frightful beyond all humanity, will be cast upon the
pebbled beach, and it may lie there long undiscovered,
amid gnats that swarm in the sunshine of
noon, and birds that scream in the night&mdash;ay, very
long, for our glens are desolate now, and for months
a human foot may never press the heather there.
That corpse will be <i>yours</i>, Mr. Snaggs!  When found,
it will excite awe and wonder, for the foolish mother
that bore you would not know her sinful son; but
anon horror and disgust will force the finders to cover
it hastily up with earth and stones; and there you
will rot, Mr. Snaggs, while your ill-gotten gear will
be spent and enjoyed by others.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, have mercy upon me!' howled Snaggs, who
now ceased to make the smallest exertion, as every
movement served more and more to dislodge the
consuming root.  'Mercy&mdash;I tell you&mdash;mercy; my dear,
good man, have mercy!'
</p>

<p>
'Dioul! how long that tree holds on!' cried
Callum, stamping his foot; 'but now it bends! now
it breaks!  Hoigh&mdash;one moment more and all will be
over, Mr. Snaggs!'
</p>

<p>
The white lips of the victim quivered; he was
uttering a voiceless prayer&mdash;or perhaps it was the
more contortion and convulsing of his features.  The
fitful light of the moon, and occasionally the gleams
of the blazing heather and distant thickets, played on
the rocks and wild plants of the chasm, imparting a
satanic effect to the episode.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the tree snapped with a crash that made
my heart leap, and with a cry, amid a shower of
sparks that flew upward, Snaggs vanished with the
half-burned stem into the black gulf below, where the
fierce and foaming mountain-torrent swept them away
like autumn leaves, towards the deeper waters of the
Loch, and the more distant waves of the Atlantic.
</p>

<p>
I never heard that his corpse was found.
</p>

<p>
'It is God's judgment,' said Callum, who had gazed
frigidly at this terrible sight, the realities of which
I could not reconcile for a time, or believe to be
palpable and true.

CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><br />
THE RUINED COTTAGE.
</h3>

<p>
'Those who do injuries to others,' says the delightful
author of <i>I promessè Sposi</i>, 'are not only accountable
for the evil they inflict, but also for the perversion of
sentiment which they cause in their victims.'  I am
happy that this trite sentence occurred to me, for by
this mode of reasoning we shall find Mr. Snaggs
alone guilty of Callum's unusual hardness of heart,
and, in short, the author of his own untimely demise.
</p>

<p>
Chilled and almost terrified by the new and awful
events of the night, I hastened away by the route we
had come, descending the face of the rocks towards
that part of the stream which lay below the cascade,
and proceeding along its banks among the wet
water-docks and green leaves which the fire, that was
still raging in many parts of the muirland district.
had failed to consume.  Midnight was past now.  The
moon was waning behind the summit of the scorched
and burning hills.  We were weary and looked about
us for a shelter; but in every direction the country
seemed dotted by the fires which yet smouldered in
the thickets and morasses, reddening and flashing in
every puff of wind.
</p>

<p>
'Free&mdash;but homeless, houseless, penniless, and
desperate!' said I.
</p>

<p>
'A chial!' responded my fosterer; 'how many
brethren we have in this wide world, which is all
before us now!'
</p>

<p>
A ruined cottage afforded us a resting-place, and
there we threw ourselves down upon the thick soft
grass that was springing up within its four bare walls
of turf and boulder-stones.  I was so overcome by
lassitude, that even the supernatural terrors of this
place failed to scare me from it, and Callum, who
would rather have passed the night in any other part
of the mountains, could not leave me.  A mouthful
of whisky from his hunting-flask revived us, and to
change the current of my thoughts, which were
incessantly and upbraidingly reverting to the terrible
scenes we had just witnessed, he told me several wild
and quaint stories of Dougald-with-the-Keys, the
former occupant of the ruined cottage, and in whose
service Callum had been when a boy.
</p>

<p>
Dougald was a smuggler and distiller of illicit spirits.
He had his manufactory in a hollow of the adjacent
morass, a high rock overlooking which was the post
of his scout.  Malie, his lynx-eyed wife, generally
watched for the hated exciseman, who might be
wandering along the road from Inverness or Tain.  He
was named Dougald-with-the-Keys, from a bunch of
mysterious keys which he bore at his sporran-belt.
These rattled when he walked, and gave him, it was
averred, a mysterious power; for once, when
conveying to Inverness two casks of the mountain-dew,
slung across a stout pony, two excisemen gave him
chase, and being well mounted, were about to make
a capture of Dougald's distillation; but near the
source of the Ora he shook his keys at them, and
plucking a sprig of rowan, planted it by the wayside,
uttering certain strange and terrible words.  On
approaching the sprig, the pursuers felt themselves
constrained to alight from their saddles, and to dance
round it furiously, hand-in-hand, while Dougald
laughed and proceeded safely on his journey towards
the Highland capital.  The frantic and involuntary
gyrations of the unfortunate excisemen were
continued for more than two hours, until a passing
shepherd pulled up the rowan-sprig, dissolved the spell,
and permitted them to fall prostrate on the road,
breathless, powerless, terrified, and resolved never
more to meddle with Dougald, who continued to
smuggle and distil in success and security, and had
large sums to his credit, standing in the books of
various discreet retailers in the vicinity of the
Clachnacudden.
</p>

<p>
Once upon a time Callum had been despatched
thither for payment, and was returning to the glen
with a purse well filled with silver 'Georges,' and
mounted on the active shelty which usually carried
the casks.  Pleased with the large sum he had to pay
over to the gloomy, fierce, and avaricious Dougald,
he switched up the nag as he entered the glen, and
hastened on, for the double purpose of ridding himself
of this important cash, and obtaining his supper.
</p>

<p>
The cottage and its little outhouses were buried in
obscurity when he approached them; all was dark,
yet the hour was not late, and, save a real or fancied
sound of lamentation, all was still.  According to his
usual custom, Callum rode straight to the stable door,
slipped from the bare-backed pony, which he had
ridden in the Highland fashion, in his kilt, sans bridle
and crupper.  On opening the door, for the purpose
of bedding and foddering the little nag, he heard a
well-known rattling of keys.  The sound seemed to
be in the air!  The pony started&mdash;snorted&mdash;perspired
and trembled; its eyes shot fire; its fore-feet were
firmly planted on the ground, and remained immovable.
Again the keys were heard rattling, and between
him and the moon, Callum saw the figure of
Dougald pass like a shadow along the summit of the
little garden wall.  The pony then sprang into the
stable with a convulsive bound.  An indescribable
emotion&mdash;a horror filled the heart of my fosterer;
and closing his eyes, lest he might see something still
more appalling, he flung down a few armfuls of hay
and straw to the pony, locked the stable door, and
sprang into the cottage, to find Dougald stretched on
the floor, a corpse, and his wife, Malie, lamenting
over him; for at the instant Callum had seen his
figure passing, as it were, through the air, he had
sunk down and expired of some disease unknown.
</p>

<p>
Such stories as these, and others, Callum related in
low and impressive whispers, and his powerful and
poetical Gaelic, which invested every trifle with
pathos or with terror, were but ill calculated to soothe
a mind which ever and anon in fancy saw the pale
visage and glaring eyes of Snaggs; thus I was glad
when the breaking day began to brighten in the east,
and we left the ruined hut of Dougald the Smuggler
to survey the country, which was all black, burned,
and desolate.  Its aspect was strange and terrible; a
sea of flame seemed to have rolled over it, sweeping
every trace of life and verdure from its surface.  The
origin of that nocturnal fire was then involved in
mystery; but the game over eighteen square miles
was irretrievably destroyed, and Callum laughed in
scorn.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Let this be a hint</i> for our Highlanders!' said he.
</p>

<p>
The desolation of the scene was now complete, as
that which Abraham saw of old, when looking
towards the cities of the Doomed, he beheld the smoke
of The Land of the Plain, ascending as the smoke of
a furnace.  A stripe of green was lingering on the
lofty places, but all was scorched below; thus
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In mountain or in glen,<br />
  Nor tree, nor plant, nor shrub, nor flower,<br />
  Nor aught of vegetative power,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wearied eye may ken;<br />
  But all its rocks at random thrown,<br />
  Black waves, bare crags, and banks of stone."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
All this occurred only three years ago, but subsequent
events have rendered the concealment of poor
Callum's name unnecessary now.
</p>

<p>
Three days elapsed before the fire exhausted itself,
or was extinguished, on the thickets being cut down
in some places by the axe, and the heather torn up in
others, to bar their progress.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the sufferings of the poor evicted people,
who were bivouacked in the burial-ground of
St. Colme, had been terrible.  In their hunger and
despair, some of them had made a species of meal or
flour from the leaves and seed of the wild mustard,
and bruising them together, had kneaded a kind of
cake, which, when eaten with mountain herbs, brought
on deadly inflammations and fluxes, of which they
died so fast, that the frightful condition of the
survivors reached the ears of the humane in the
Lowlands.  But why dwell on a subject that is of daily
occurrence in the Scottish Highlands, and with the
hourly horrors of which the columns of the northern
press are constantly filled?
</p>

<p>
A subscription was prepared for them, in common
with the miserable Rosses, who were then being
driven out of Sutherland, and the starved Mac
Donnels, who were then hunted down like wild beasts in
Glenelg; but this relief was soon abandoned, through
the malevolence of the usual enemy of the Celtic
population&mdash;a scurrilous Edinburgh print, of which
Mac Fee, in common with other small wits of the
Scottish Parliament House, was of course a supporter.
Charity thus arrested and withheld, the result proved
most fatal to the poor people of Glen Ora, who died
daily&mdash;the strong man and the tender child together.
</p>

<p>
At last, as I have stated, the authorities, who had
been packing our peasantry in ships like negroes from
Africa, and despatching them in naked hordes from
Isle Ornsay and elsewhere to America and Australia,
proposed to the miserable remnant of the Mac Innons
that they too should sail for that far-off land of the
West, where the sun of the Celtic tribes is setting,
and with something of despair they consented, for the
most cruel and terrible ultimatum&mdash;death by starvation
and exposure menaced them all.
</p>

<p>
I will pass over the touching scenes that ensued
when the last of our people were torn from their
native district, every feature and memory of which
were entwined around their hearts&mdash;torn from their
ruined homes&mdash;their father's lonely graves&mdash;from all
they had loved since childhood, and when they were
thrust, without regard to sex or age, on board of a
small steamer in Loch Ora, for conveyance to Glasgow,
where the great emigrant&mdash;or Celtic slave-ship,
the <i>Duchess</i>, awaited them.
</p>

<p>
Many of these poor people, after the usual custom
of the evicted Highlanders, made up little packages
of earth&mdash;their native soil&mdash;-to bear it with them to
the wilds of America, as a relic or memento of their
country; and in the hope that, in this little handful
might be the seeds of the heather-bell and other
native plants and flowers.  Strong, deep, and undying
is this pure and noble&mdash;this holy love of home,
in the Highland heart.  The unavailing sorrow, the
unheeded agony, the mental and bodily misery of our
evicted emigrants is a theme so constantly before the
public, that we now regard the depopulation of a
valley as quite a usual occurrence, like the fall of the
leaf or the coming of summer; hence I will pass
over this part of iny narrative as briefly as possible.
</p>

<p>
The people sailed for Glasgow, and Callum and I,
who were to follow and join them in a day or two,
stood on the shore of the loch, and saw the steamer
ploughing through its still blue waters, as it bore
away the sad and wailing freight.
</p>

<p>
Near us, on the beach, knelt a man in prayer; his
white hairs were glistening in the setting sun; his
eyes were bent upon the lessening steamer, and his
hands were stretched towards her.  This was old
Father Raouil, who was sending his last blessing
after those on whose faces he would never look again.
</p>

<p>
Near him knelt Callum Dhu, with his bare knees
in the sand, and his rough sunburned face covered by
his bonnet&mdash;for the strong man had now given way,
and was weeping like a child.
</p>

<p>
We are literally <i>the last of the clan</i>.
</p>

<p>
We watched the steamer till she diminished to a
speck, and vanished round a promontory; then we
turned away, and, mechanically and in silence,
ascended the desolate mountains, a community of
thought&mdash;a unity of sentiment&mdash;leading us instinctively
towards the deserted glen, although neither
home nor tie remained unto us there.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV
<br /><br />
THE WHITE STAG.
</h3>

<p>
The excitement of this temporary separation over,
my thoughts now reverted to Laura Everingham,
whom I had not seen since the day of my mother's
funeral, and from whom I was now on the verge of
being separated for ever&mdash;separated so hopelessly,
that my heart sickened at the contemplation.
</p>

<p>
Oh how different were my fate, my fortune and
position from those of that bright and happy girl,
whose sunny English face and beaming eyes spoke
only of a heart that had never known care or thought
or bitterness.  Now budding from the spring of youth
into the summer of womanhood, her figure, though
rather undersized, was beautiful and graceful, lithe
and faultless, as all her pretty little ways were
amiable and winning.  There was a romance in loving
her&mdash;a desperation in it that excited all my ardour;
and (as Washington Irving says) 'do not let us
consider whatever is romantic as incompatible with real
life.'
</p>

<p>
My hitherto isolated existence had given me few
opportunities of seeing much of the world; hence,
unhackneyed in its ways, I loved Laura more deeply
and devotedly than I was quite aware of until this
time of separation came.
</p>

<p>
Rambling erratically and in silence, Callum and I
reached a sequestered part of the banks of the Ora,
which had escaped the fires of the late conflagration.
</p>

<p>
The sun was setting now, and its golden rays
played upon the water, above the surface of which
the salmon rose at times, while the heron stalked
among the sedges.  A few corn-patches, sown by
those whose hands would <i>never reap them</i>, were
turning from pale green to warm yellow on the southern
slope of the hills; the heather about us was in bloom;
the wild flowers spread their fragrant garlands over
the volcanic rocks, and the honey-bee hummed
drowsily in the summer sunshine.
</p>

<p>
The scarlet berries of the mountain-ash kissed the
sparkling current of this beautiful river, which
teemed with spotted salmon; but these were all
bought up for the southern markets, and it was as
much as a man's life was worth to drop a line into
its waters.  All was solemn silence round us now.
An occasional deer scrambling along a ridge of rocks,
and rolling the loose stones down the slope, where
they continued to rebound until the sound died in
the hollow below; or the splash of a large salmon,
attempting to leap <i>up</i> the falls of the Ora, alone woke
the echoes of the solitude.
</p>

<p>
A huge grey polecat, about three feet long, gazed
at us from a fragment of rock without moving, and
with an expression of wonder in its savage eyes; for
by the result of the game-restrictions and other
Draconian laws of our Highland feudatories, God's image
was becoming somewhat as scarce in these districts
as in Breadalbane, Sutherland, or on the Braes of
Lochaber.
</p>

<p>
As the sunset lingered on our magnificent native
mountains, Callum and I gazed about in silence.
Every spot had its old and quaint&mdash;its terrible or
beautiful&mdash;associations and traditions.  On one side
lay an inlet of the sea, blue, deep and overshadowed
by the impending rocks, which were alleged in the
days of our fathers to have been the haunt of the
<i>Mhaidan Mhare</i>, or Water Virgin, a being with
snow-white skin and flowing golden hair, and having a
melodious voice, which mingled with the ripple of
the waves, and foretold the coming rain.  On the
other side, deeper and darker still, lay a lonely
mountain pool, from the oozy depth of which the <i>Taru
Uisc</i>, or Water Bull, was wont to rise at midnight, to
bellow horribly at the waning moon, and to scare
the little fairies who danced among the velvet grass
and blue bells, which covered the Sioth Dhunan, or
Hills of Peace, which Druid hands had formed perhaps
three thousand years ago, by the margin of their
holy lake.  Between us and the flush of the western
sky rose the stupendous circle of their temple, the
blocks of which were said to be enchanted, so that
one might count them a hundred times, and never
find the same number twice.  Farther off rose a ridge
named Druim-na-dears, or the Hill of Tears; for
there two hundred of our men, who joined the 42nd
Highlanders, had waved their bonnets in farewell
for the last time, and of that two hundred only <i>one</i>
came back to tell how his comrades had all perished
with Brigadier Howe, before the ramparts of Ticonderoga.
</p>

<p>
Thus every stone, and rock and linn around us,
had their memories, their poetry, their imaginary
tenants or their terrors&mdash;their tales of the times of
old&mdash;and all these we were leaving for ever!
</p>

<p>
Our occasional communings and regrets, with many
a long pause between, were suddenly arrested by a
shrill cry of terror.  We started from the grassy bank
on which we had been seated, and saw a lady, wearing
a broad hat and feather, and mounted on a little
mountain pony, coming at full speed down a narrow
path towards the deep and rapid stream, pursued
by a furious stag&mdash;the far-famed <i>white stag</i> of Loch
Ora!
</p>

<p>
With something of fear I gazed upon this gigantic
animal, which, since my infancy, I had been taught
to believe had a supernatural existence, and to be the
forerunner of evil to the race of Mac Innon; but the
reiterated cry of the fair fugitive filled my heart with
other thoughts, on recognizing Laura Everingham,
when wild with terror, and pale, as the fear of a
dreadful death could make her, she rushed past me
on her fierce little Highland garron.  My resolution
was formed in a moment; and before the stronger
and perhaps braver Callum Dhu, had arranged his
thoughts on the subject, I had sprung forward and
unsheathed the skene which I always wore in my
right garter.  Rising superior to the flood of gloomy
and despairing thoughts which had made me their
victim, and heedless whether the terrible and
traditionary stag slew me and ended all my sorrows at
the feet of Laura, I rushed upon it with my
skene-dhu&mdash;a weapon only four inches long.
</p>

<p>
The fury of my thoughts gave me treble strength,
and insured me victory.
</p>

<p>
The aspect of this animal was appalling; its red
eyes shot fire; a moment it paused, bellowing, roaring,
and raking and stabbing, as it tore up the purple
heather with its giant antlers; but with a cry of
triumph I rushed full at him, and escaping by a
blessed mercy his terrible array of points, buried my
sharp skene-dhu in his broad chest.
</p>

<p>
Back went the noble head with its lofty antlers,
the fore-legs were extended, and the knees bent as the
red life-blood gushed out in torrents; but again and
again my black knife was buried to its hilt in the
snow-white chest of the stag&mdash;the wondrous stag of
the Mac Innons!
</p>

<p>
His head rose and fell; his whole frame vibrated;
he lolled out a hot steaming tongue, and sank at my
feet, dead&mdash;this strange creature of a hundred
gloomy legends&mdash;leaving me covered with gore&mdash;panting
with excitement, and with the hilt of my
skene-dhu glued to my right hand by the hideous
puddle that had gushed upon it at each successive
death-blow.
</p>

<p>
Laura was saved, and by <i>me</i>!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap25"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><br />
THE GAEL AND THE SAXON.
</h3>

<p>
'Hoigh, Mac Innon!' exclaimed Callum Dhu, with
a shout of triumph; 'such a feat has not been done
since old Glengarry slew the wild stag in the pass of
Glendulochan!'
</p>

<p>
I lifted Laura (who was faint and almost sick with
terror) from her pony, and placed her on the soft
grassy bank, where I besought her to be calm, as all
danger was now past; but, on perceiving that my
right hand and arm were drenched in blood, she
uttered a cry, and clasping my left hand in hers,
asked me in the most moving terms whether 'I was
hurt&mdash;if I was safe&mdash;uninjured&mdash;to speak to her, to
say whether I was wounded or not?'
</p>

<p>
I forget alike her exact words and my answer;
for we were both trembling and confused; but in
that moment of excitement each had revealed to the
other, more of mutual regard than any circumstance,
save danger, could have drawn forth.  On recovering
a little, I said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'For the act of to-day, I trust, Miss Everingham,
that you will think of me kindly when I am
gone.'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Kindly!</i>' she exclaimed, while her blooming
prettiness became absolute beauty, as her fine eyes
beamed, and her face filled with ardour, and with an
expression of gratitude and joy; 'ah how can you
speak so coldly&mdash;kindly?&mdash;say gratefully, lovingly,
prayerfully.  You will ever have all the
gratitude&mdash;the esteem, my heart can feel!'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, dear Miss Everingham,' I replied, kissing
her hand, while my voice and lips trembled; '<i>esteem</i>
is the first element of love.  Without it no passion
can endure.'
</p>

<p>
She grew pale&mdash;looked down, and trembled.
</p>

<p>
'And you go?&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'But, when?' she asked, lifting her eyes sadly to
mine.
</p>

<p>
'To-morrow.'
</p>

<p>
'And you return!&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Never.'
</p>

<p>
'Never?' she reiterated.
</p>

<p>
'Never&mdash;oh never!  I go to return no more.  It is
the doom of our race, my dear Miss Everingham.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh say not so&mdash;but here comes dearest papa to
thank you in better words than I can command.'
</p>

<p>
As she spoke, Sir Horace, accompanied by Miss
Clavering, the Captain and Mr. Snobleigh, came down
the mountain-path at a furious gallop, and with high
alarm depicted in all their faces; however, a glance
at the dead stag, at Laura seated, smiling on the bank,
and her pony quietly cropping the grass beside her,
explained in a moment that she was in perfect safety.
Moreover, from the top of the hill, they had seen me
rush upon the stag, and lay it dead at my feet.  My
skene-dhu, dripping with blood, explained all the
rest.
</p>

<p>
'Dearest Laura&mdash;and you are safe!' exclaimed
Fanny Clavering, flinging off her broad hat as she
sprang from her pony, and hurried to embrace her
friend; 'oh heaven, my dear girl, I wish we were all
safe again in London, or at Elton Hall!  We have
been little more than six months in these atrocious
Highlands, and yet we have first had your papa&mdash;dear
old stupid thing! nearly drowned; then we were all
but burned alive in the shrubbery the other night;
and to-day you on the verge of being torn to pieces
by a wild animal!'
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;aw&mdash;Miss Everingham&mdash;you would be
wilful,' yawned Snobleigh, 'and would go&mdash;aw into
that fwightful jungle, where we lost you&mdash;the wood
of&mdash;of&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Coil-chro.'
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;yes&mdash;those devilish 'Ighland names!'
</p>

<p>
'I know of no better fun than to have a fine man
of the Guards essaying to get his lazy tongue round
an Argyleshire, or a Galway name.  And so it was
you, my brave fellow, who slew this noble stag?'
asked the impulsive Fanny, blushing, as she laid her
hand on the shoulder of Callum, who was kneeling
on the grass, and feeling the dead animal with his
hands.
</p>

<p>
'I&mdash;madam?&mdash;No; it was slain by the chief&mdash;my
master; and it is a deed that would long be remembered
in Glen Ora, were there other inhabitants now
than the red-roes and the moor-fowl.'
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;my dear fellow, get your hands washed, for
weally that wed blood is atwocious, 'pon my soul
it is.'
</p>

<p>
'Stuff, Snobleigh,' said Captain Clavering; 'what
the deuce does a little blood matter?  You have done
well and nobly, Mac Innon; but you look a little
pale&mdash;you are not hurt, I hope?'
</p>

<p>
'Not in the least.'
</p>

<p>
'Why don't you speak, Sir Horace?' said Miss
Clavering, impetuously; 'have you not a tongue to
thank him who saved your daughter's life?'
</p>

<p>
'I have a tongue, but not words, my dear Miss
Clavering,' said the cold and pompous baronet.  'You
have saved my Laura from a terrible death, sir,' he
continued, addressing me with a warmth of manner
somewhat unusual in him; 'stay among us, Mr. Mac
Innon, and I shall leave nothing undone for your
welfare&mdash;that is, if it is in my power, of course.'
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;of course,' chorused the languid Snobleigh.
</p>

<p>
'Do, Mr. Mac Innon,' added Fanny Clavering,
bending her bright and beautiful eyes upon me, while
she laid her pretty hand upon my arm; 'do, and all
the past shall be forgotten.'
</p>

<p>
'Your offer comes too late, Sir Horace,' said I, in a
broken voice, 'though my heart is rent in two by
this separation from my native country&mdash;with that
separation every tie is broken.  Restore the people&mdash;restore
that now ruined hamlet and desolate glen to
what it was a month ago; give me back my poor old
mother from her cold grave on yonder promontory,
that grave to which your severity or the cruelty of
your underlings drove her, and <i>then</i> speak of remaining
here; but not till then.'
</p>

<p>
'Arms are the natural profession of a Highlander,'
said Captain Clavering, putting a hand on my
shoulder in his frank English way; 'could you, Sir
Horace, not do something for him at the Horse
Guards?&mdash;Devilish sorry that I have no interest in
that quarter myself.'
</p>

<p>
'It would afford me the utmost gratification to do
so,' replied the stiff and pompous baronet, in his
coldest manner; '<i>but</i> really, the fact is, I do not feel
myself at liberty to ask a favour from any of the
present administration.'
</p>

<p>
'The deuce you don't?'
</p>

<p>
'Aw&mdash;of course,' hummed Snobleigh.
</p>

<p>
And there was an end of it; though I would have
died rather than accepted the smallest favour at his
hands.  To be patronized by <i>him</i>!  The idea was
enough to call my mother's fiery spirit back to earth.
</p>

<p>
As a huntsman, Callum was now, by mere force of
habit, proceeding to gralloch the stag with his
sharpened skene; and as this work progressed,
unfortunately for the legends of our glensmen, he found
it to be&mdash;not two hundred years old&mdash;but a fine
<i>warrantable stag</i> of at least six summers.
</p>

<p>
'Well, my friend, the fox-hunter,' said Clavering;
'could you not stay among us&mdash;I'll take the odds on
it, Sir Horace could do something for you.'
</p>

<p>
'Likely enough,' said the baronet, mounting; 'you
would make a first-rate gamekeeper.'
</p>

<p>
'Many thanks, sir,' replied Callum, touching his
bonnet with a fierce and covert irony gleaming in
his dark eyes; 'but the time has gone past, Englishman,
for that too; we go, we go to return no more!
You purchased this land, true; any other depopulating
game speculator might have done so; but he
who sold it to you&mdash;was it <i>his</i> to sell?  It belonged to
the people and not to him.  The land was God's gift
to the Gael; it is theirs, and all the produce thereof
is theirs.'
</p>

<p>
'This is a thief's maxim,' said Sir Horace, sharply.
</p>

<p>
'To you it may seem so; but we have a saying
among us&mdash;<i>Breac na linne, slàt na coille, s'fiadh na fireach
meirladh nach do gabh duine riamh nair as</i>.
</p>

<p>
'What the devil is all that in English?  it sounds
like the croaking of frogs in a Dutch canal.'
</p>

<p>
'It means, that a fish from the stream, a stag from
the mountain, or a tree from the forest are no thefts,
but the right of he who wants them.'
</p>

<p>
'Why sirrah, this is poaching or trespassing, as
Snaggs would tell you, had he not disappeared so
unaccountably.  I must teach these Highland fellows,
Clavering, to respect the sacred laws of property!  I
have as much right to the wood and water, and game,
as to anything else.  "If the sun goes down on my
property," says the <i>Man made of Money</i>, "I have a clear
title to that sunset; if the clouds, over my land, are
remarkably fine, they are my clouds."  A noble maxim!
Then does not the same rule apply to the pheasants,
plover, curlew, deer, and foxes&mdash;eh?'
</p>

<p>
'You are a stranger here,' retorted Callum, 'and
consequently know no better.  God&mdash;blessed be his
name!&mdash;never sent a little mouth into the world
without providing food for it.  There was a time
when, in these glens, we had food enough to spare;
but, a chial! for the devil came in breeks and took it
away from us.'
</p>

<p>
'This bores me,' said Sir Horace: 'Clavering, assist
Laura and your sister to mount; we'll send some one
for the stag.  Many thanks, good fellow, for your
cutting and carving it thus&mdash;but please to let it alone.
Ah&mdash;a good evening and a safe voyage to you, Mr. Mac
Innon,' and with a brief nod, Sir Horace walked
his shooting pony leisurely up the slope.
</p>

<p>
Laura and Miss Clavering reluctantly followed
him; but both bade me kindly&mdash;the former
silently&mdash;adieu.  I knew that in the twilight she was weeping
behind her veil, and my heart was deeply moved, for
I might never behold her again.  Snobleigh&mdash;the
empty, vacant and insipid Snobleigh&mdash;bowed and
cantered after them; but Clavering lingered still,
and said,
</p>

<p>
'I feel sincere regret, Mac Innon, to see a bold
young fellow like you, flung upon this cold and
faithless world&mdash;can I do anything for you?'
</p>

<p>
'I thank you, sir&mdash;but know of nothing.'
</p>

<p>
'We are now at war with Russia&mdash;you have thus
before you a noble field for action.'
</p>

<p>
'And after the treatment I have experienced in my
own country, I should justly seek it in the Russian
ranks.  You are right, Captain Clavering&mdash;I thank
you; war is the natural resource of the desperate and
poor; but alas!  I have neither interest nor money
to enter the service.'
</p>

<p>
'Deuced awkward&mdash;and we have no volunteering
in this war.  But think over all I have said, for it is
a devil of a thing to take to felling of trees and
draining swamps in the Far West, leaving civilization far
behind you, and having the Pacific and the Red men
in your front, while your nearest chum dwells three
hundred miles off&mdash;and there you will fight with the
Indians, the earth and the elements, to feed a little
herd of snivelling Yankees, who will grow up in hatred
of the land their fathers came from.  It won't do, my
dear fellow&mdash;think over it, and if I can do anything
for you, drop me a line at Glen Ora House, or at
the Western Club, Glasgow, where I shall be in a
day or so, about the happiest piece of business in the
world.  Adieu!'
</p>

<p>
With these words we separated, and Callum and I
were left on the dark hill-side; the last glow of
sunset had faded away, and the mysterious white stag
of Loch Ora was lying at our feet dead, motionless,
and still as a drift of snow.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><br />
A LAST INTERVIEW.
</h3>

<p>
To-morrow evening, the steamer from Loch Linnhe
for Oban and Glasgow, would touch at Loch Ora, and
with it, Callum and I were to leave our native
district for ever.  The bitter, crushing, and painful
sinking of the heart that accompanied this conviction
was increased by the knowledge that never again
would I see the face or hear the voice of Laura.
Grinding poverty on one hand, and wealth on the
other, had reared a solid rampart between us; yet I
still loved Laura, despite the hopelessness of that
love, which made me feel more bitterly than ever
that a poor gentleman is the most miserable of all
God's creatures.
</p>

<p>
Callum, my fosterer, though to me, ever gentle as
a woman and faithful as a dog, was alternately morose
or silent, and appalled by our approaching departure;
and as he lay that night on some freshly-pulled
heather, in a corner of poor Father Raoul's humble
hut, I heard him sobbing under the tattered plaid
which enveloped his head and shoulders; for his
gallant heart and strong resolution were failing him
at last.
</p>

<p>
My whole thoughts were of Laura now, for my
hopeless separation from her, conflicted with my
regret on leaving my desolated home.  The craving
desire to see her once again became uncontrollable,
and desiring Callum to wait for me, by a near and
familiar path&mdash;never again to be trod by me&mdash;I
hastened up the glen, which led directly to the new
manor-house of Glen Ora.
</p>

<p>
It was a narrow road which led of old to the
stronghold of our tribe, and there had been a time when
none could have thought that a Mac Innon would
ever ascend it in such bitterness of soul as I then
endured.  The tower&mdash;the home of a race whose
source even tradition failed to trace&mdash;was demolished
now, and the huge square modern villa of the baronet
crowned its site; but all unchanged with its shade of
silver birch was the bramble-covered path by which
for ages
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'The hunter of deer and the warrior trod<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his hills that encircle the sea.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Everything spoke to me of home and farewell.  The
murmur of the dark pines that shaded the hills; the
hiss of a little cascade, falling in foam down the old
grey rocks, like the end of a silvery scarf; the sun
lingering like a globe of fire above the dark shoulder
of Ben Ora.  The little cascade seemed to have its
source in the clouds, and, like a silver shower, the
light wind flung its spray abroad upon the turf and
flowers.
</p>

<p>
A moment I lingered there, and thought it would
be a boon to be dead and buried in peace on that
green mountain slope, where the heather might wave
and the deer bound over me; for the dread of dying
in a far distant land is strong in the heart of every
mountaineer.
</p>

<p>
But enough of such thoughts and themes.
</p>

<p>
Full of them, however, I reached the new birchen
avenue which led to the elegant manor-house of Sir
Horace Everingham, and without having conceived
how I should achieve the desired interview with
Laura, or what means to pursue.
</p>

<p>
I lurked among the trees and shrubbery, watching
the windows for nearly half an hour, fearing to be
seen, hopeless of seeing her alone if I saw her at all,
and trembling with anxiety, for every moment was of
priceless value to me.  I saw the falling shadows
lengthening to the eastward, and knew that when the
sun sank below the shoulder of the Ben, the
Highland steamer would be at the pier of the loch.
</p>

<p>
An exclamation of joy escaped me, as a drawing-room
window which unfolded to the floor was opened,
and she&mdash;Laura herself&mdash;stepped out into the gravel-walk
of the garden, not a pistol-shot distant from
where I was concealed.
</p>

<p>
She was attired in a very becoming evening
costume; she had her broad hat slung by its ribbons
over her left arm, and had an open volume in her
right hand.  She looked pale and thoughtful, but was
neither sad, nor bearing a trace of tears.  This
disappointed me, as she must have known that this was
the eve of my final departure; but the claim I had
on her regard and memory was too slight&mdash;and
among so many gay friends and accomplished admirers,
and amid so much luxury, it might easily be
effaced and forgotten.
</p>

<p>
My heart beat like lightning, as she approached
and entered a summer-seat, which was shrouded by a
little dome, and four sides of iron wire, in the fashion
of a Turkish kiosk, and was covered completely with
roses and honeysuckle.  I quickly crept towards it,
and&mdash;-as my evil fortune would have it&mdash;had only
time to ensconce and conceal myself among the ample
laurel-bushes close by, when the voice of the gay and
laughing Fanny Clavering, who had been asleep, I
presume, in the arbour, fell suddenly on my ear, as
she at once resumed what appeared to be a former
conversation.  To all this I was compelled to listen.
It may be the reverse of etiquette to repeat what
passes in private, and still more so, aught we may
chance to overhear; but there would be a fearful
hiatus in many a veracious history, in mine in
particular, without those opportune eaves-droppings;
besides, I believe that no man in this world could
resist the desire to listen, 'with all the ears in his
head,' if he deemed himself the subject of conversation
between two pretty women.  Thus, as much that
passed between these fair friends concerned myself, I
hearkened with an anxiety that was the more painful,
as I dared not, for very shame, avow or discover
myself.
</p>

<p>
The two girls were seated near each other.  Laura
had resigned her book, and was twirling the ribbons
of her broad summer hat round her slender fingers.
Fanny had her white hands thrust into the pockets of
a very bewitching little black silk apron, and her
beautiful features, her fine eyes, and nose <i>retroussé</i>,
wore the most droll and arch expression in the world.
</p>

<p>
'Come now, Fanny, don't be silly,' said Laura.
</p>

<p>
'Is it possible that you have lived to the age of
twenty without having one dear little affair of the
heart?'
</p>

<p>
'Not one, Fanny&mdash;and <i>you</i>?&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, don't speak of my heart, pray&mdash;it has been
broken twenty times.  But, don't you know, love,
that an engagement of the heart is a most delightful
thing?'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps so&mdash;but mine is only formed for friendship.'
</p>

<p>
'Fiddlestick! one lover is worth a hundred friends.'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, Fanny; I think <i>one</i> friend worth a thousand
lovers; and I never met with a man capable of
inspiring in me more than the merest friendship.'
</p>

<p>
'And how about my brother Tom?'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, nay, Fanny; now don't look so archly.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, then&mdash;our young Highland friend?'
</p>

<p>
Laura was silent, and became very pale.
</p>

<p>
'Speak?'
</p>

<p>
'You are a dear droll!' said Laura, making an
effort to laugh, after a pause; 'well&mdash;<i>he</i> is both
handsome and winning.'
</p>

<p>
'But so innocent&mdash;so particularly verdant.'
</p>

<p>
'Yet that innocence of dissipated life charms me.'
</p>

<p>
'I am excessively amused!  But you cannot&mdash;dare
not, encourage this idea.  Love <i>him</i>&mdash;oh, Laura, such
a <i>mésalliance</i>! the imaginary chief of a beggarly
burned up tract in the West Highlands.  The last of
the Mohicans!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Mésalliance!</i>' reiterated Laura, with an air of
pique; 'what is our family, which dates from the
Restoration, when compared to his, which, for aught
that I know, dates from the days of Ossian.'
</p>

<p>
'Immensely superior, I should say&mdash;for the gentlemen
of Ossian's time knew deuced little about making
up a book on the Oaks, or knowing the points of the
winner of the Derby, as <i>I</i> do&mdash;or of Bank-stock, or
shares or railway scrip, and so forth, as Sir Horace
does.'
</p>

<p>
'But then, Fanny dear, think of what I owe him&mdash;that
dreadful rescue of yesterday?  Oh, there is
nothing I admire so much as bravery in a man!'
</p>

<p>
'But this is a boy.'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;a brave boy&mdash;and are we much more than
girls?'
</p>

<p>
'Such a little sophist it is!  If you run on thus I
shall end by loving that tall fellow who hunts the
foxes.  I own to be immensely delighted with him.
Is he not a love of a man, with his magnificent black
beard?'
</p>

<p>
'You have spoken more of <i>him</i> than I have done of
his master.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps I am in love with him,' said Fanny, with
a roguish expression in her beautiful eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Scarcely,' replied Laura, with a little reserve;
'for it is your style to yawn and fret to-day over all
that enchanted you yesterday.  You tire of everything.'
</p>

<p>
'And thus would very soon tire, I fear, of such a
lover as your Allan Mac Innon.  He is but a wild
Highland boy&mdash;I should like a man with a lofty
presence&mdash;a man of whom I should feel proud, even
when I had tired of him, and ceased to love him.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Fanny!  I <i>am</i> proud of him, in my own quiet
and unobtrusive little way.  He is so bold, so hardy,
so active, and so manly!' said poor Laura, blushing
deeply at her own energy, while my heart beat
with tumultuous joy; 'his eyes, too&mdash;do they not tell
the history of a sad and thoughtful life?  He is like
the Mac Ivor of Waverley.'
</p>

<p>
'There it is! you have caught the tartan fever,
which is nearly as bad as the scarlet one, and may be
worse now, since the Line have lost their epaulettes.
Well, I should like a lover of whom one would not
be ashamed to make one's husband.'
</p>

<p>
'Husband&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
Laura was silent; and, trembling with joy, I forgot
all about poor Callum Dhu, who was seated patiently
with my baggage on the pier, awaiting the steamer
which was now coming down the loch.
</p>

<p>
'Young Mac Innon is so poor, so wild, so strange!'
resumed the painfully plain-spoken Fanny.
</p>

<p>
'These only make me the more his friend.'
</p>

<p>
'And we all know that "friendship in woman is
kindred to love."  He is quite like a young robber.'
</p>

<p>
'Well,' replied Laura, taking up her lively friend's
rattling manner, 'I always thought it would be
divine to marry a bandit!  When we travelled from
Rome to Naples, I looked daily for a handsome young
brigand in a sugar-loaf hat, velvet jacket, and those
red bandages which no outlaw is ever without&mdash;a
Masseroni&mdash;a Fra Diavalo&mdash;but, alas! none ever
came, and we jogged as quietly along the Appian
Way as if it had been Rotten Row or the Canterbury-road.'
</p>

<p>
'But as we have had enough about Allan Mac
Innon, now let us recur to our constant theme&mdash;my
brother Tom and his old suit&mdash;or his friend, Snobleigh.'
</p>

<p>
<i>Recur</i>, thought I.
</p>

<p>
'I could <i>learn</i> to love your brother, perhaps, Fanny,
because he is gentlemanly, kind, and lovable; but,
as for Snobleigh&mdash;the fop, the mouthing idler&mdash;who
would propose just as coolly as he would light a
cigar, button his glove, or stroke a horse's knee, do
not speak of such an atrocity as marriage with
him&mdash;and yet he has proposed to me twice.'
</p>

<p>
'And been rejected?' asked Fanny, her dark eyes
flashing with a mixture of fun and pique.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;rejected, yet still he loiters here, devoid
alike of spirit and delicacy.'
</p>

<p>
'How did he receive your refusal?'
</p>

<p>
'Such was his provoking coolness, that I could
have boxed his ears.  Stroking his buff-coloured
moustache, which, as you know, finds him a vast
fund of employment, he adjusted his round collar and
long-skirted surtout, and yawned out, "Vewy well,
Miss Lawa&mdash;it don't mattaw&mdash;aw-aw&mdash;but, wemembaw
that, the&mdash;aw&mdash;choicest gifts of God and of the
Gwenadiaw Gawds, are&mdash;aw-aw&mdash;at your feet."'
</p>

<p>
Fanny's loud and ringing laugh at her friend's
description was interrupted by the bell to dress for
dinner; on which she murmured something about
her attire, and in her usual volatile manner, sprang
away, leaving Laura to follow her as she chose.
</p>

<p>
All that I had overheard proved unmistakably the
interest I had in Laura's heart&mdash;a discovery that
proved the foundation of much joy and pride and
future misery to me.
</p>

<p>
All that followed is dim and wavering now, as a
dream of years long past.
</p>

<p>
She was about to leave the saloon, when I stood
before her, trembling in heart and in every limb.
She grew very pale on seeing me, and I pressed her
white passive hands to my lips and to my breast, and
in such language as the agony of the moment supplied,
I thanked her for the interest she took in one
so miserable as I&mdash;and I prayed her to remember me
when gone, for never more would my voice fall on
her ear; I prayed, too, that God might bless her, and
while thus pouring out the long-treasured secret of
my heart, without daring once to touch her lips,
though she stood beside me, pale and passive as a
marble statue, I sprang away, as the voice of Clavering
was heard in the shrubbery close by.  I reached
the avenue, and leaving the park and plantations far
behind me, rushed like a deer down the glen to reach
the steamer.
</p>

<p>
There was yet time to pause a moment!
</p>

<p>
I looked back to the old primeval woods which
shaded the mansion-house of Glen Ora, and to the
fire-scathed mountains that overhung it.  Strange to
say, I had now no bitterness in my heart, for Laura
was their heiress, and I loved her more than all the
world.  I gave a parting glance at that beloved
scenery now deepening in the summer gloaming.
Glen Ora was dark and silent now&mdash;dark as if the
shadow of death lay on it&mdash;and silent and voiceless
as the grave, the last home of our people.
</p>

<p>
Sorrow and love were struggling in my heart, and
sad, solemn, and terrible thoughts rose within me.
</p>

<p>
As each familiar object faded away and melted
into night, then came to my heart the bitter conviction
that I was a houseless wanderer, with the wide
world all before me&mdash;that I was without country,
friends, or home&mdash;but of the right mettle to become
a brave and reckless soldier.
</p>

<p>
My country indeed!
</p>

<p>
I would have cursed her!  What did I owe her? nothing.
But she owed me a debt of blood&mdash;the blood
of more than thirty of my own name and kindred,
who had perished in her reckless wars&mdash;dying bravely
sword in hand, and in the king's service&mdash;for in
legions have the men of the clans gone forth to battle
for Britain, and now ruin, treachery, extirpation and
obloquy, with the garbage of the public press, are
heaped upon the remnant who remain.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVII.
<br /><br />
DUMBARTON.
</h3>

<p>
Callum Dhu, with my little baggage, had awaited me
with some anxiety; but I joined him at the pier in
time to reach the steamer which was to take us to the
Clyde.
</p>

<p>
When I told him of all that had passed, his dark eyes
flashed, and his swarthy cheek glowed, and slapping
his bare knee, he exclaimed:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Dioul! now or never is the time to make your
fortune, like Donald Gair or Robin Oig.  Marry the
Englishman's daughter, and Glen Ora&mdash;hill, wood,
and water&mdash;shall all be ours again!'
</p>

<p>
But the monotonous flap-flap-flapping of the
steamer's screw was the only reply he heard, as she
bore us away for ever.
</p>

<p>
We reached the noble Clyde in due time, and
landed at Dumbarton, for there we ascertained the
<i>Duchess</i> was to take on board our emigrants.
</p>

<p>
I have often thought of the truth of the poet's
maxim, that there is a culminating point in the life of
every man, and woman too&mdash;a turn of 'the tide,'
which decides their destiny, and by which their
future is irrevocably fixed; and, as this chapter will
show, the whole current of my after-life has been
changed by the simple circumstance of this emigrant
ship being at Dumbarton instead of Glasgow.  She
was not quite ready for sea&mdash;thus three weeks slipped
away, during which I lived at a hotel, frittering
away the little funds I possessed, while my poor
emigrants (who were daily receiving fresh accessions
from the expatriated Rosses and Mac Donels)
occupied certain old storehouses and sheds upon the
quays.
</p>

<p>
One day Callum and I were sitting at a sequestered
part of the river, surveying the stupendous rock of
Dumbarton, which is cleft in two, and rises like a
mighty mitre of basalt from the channel of the Clyde,
strong and formidable in aspect, defended by cannon
and by venerable ramparts, from which the beautiful
vale of the Leven, the dark mountains of Arrochar,
and the vast expanse of the azure river are visible.
The shadow of many ages lay upon its hoary walls,
for it is the Balclutha of Ossian and of the Romans&mdash;the
Dun Britton, whence came 'the tall Galbraiths
of the Red Tower,' so famed in Celtic story.  Now
its summits were wreathed in mist; the shades of
evening were closing on it, and the red gleam of
bayonets appeared upon its walls, as the sentinels of
a Highland regiment trod to and fro upon the same
ramparts from which the soldiers of the Cæsars, in
nearly the same costume, had, eighteen hundred years
ago, kept this key of the Western Highlands and of
the navigation of the Clyde.
</p>

<p>
As I gazed at the bayonets glittering ever and anon
above the old grey bastions, the words of Clavering
came again and again to my memory, and the longing
to become a soldier, with a horror of hopeless
banishment as an emigrant, grew strong within me.  My
father had once belonged to this very regiment&mdash;the
famous fighting &mdash;th Highlanders.  My resolution
was taken in a moment.  I would see their colonel&mdash;I
would speak with him&mdash;tell my wishes and depressing
circumstances, and frankly ask his advice.
Callum loudly applauded this idea!
</p>

<p>
'He'll make a captain of you,' said he, with a
confidence that was certainly not based on a knowledge
of the service.  'Who can say nay?' he continued,
with kindling eyes; 'a Mac Innon of Glen Ora could
never be less than a captain&mdash;Mona, Mon Dioul&mdash;no! and
I shall become a soldier too, and, with five and
twenty more of our lads, will follow you to the end of
the world, and further!'
</p>

<p>
In ten minutes after this resolution was formed
we were ascending the steep pathway of the castle
rock, while Callum whistled lustily an interminable
but most warlike pibroch.  Entering by the gate
which is at the foot of the fortress, and faces the
south-east, we passed several strong ramparts, and
ascended an abrupt flight of steps into the heart of
the place, where the magazine stands, and the sword
of Sir William Wallace is preserved.  Here a few
Highland soldiers who were on guard, and who sat
smoking and lounging on a deal form in front of the
guard-house, pointed out the quarters of their colonel,
in search of whom I immediately repaired; but was
informed by an orderly that he was in the mess-room,
into which he at once ushered me without much
ceremony.
</p>

<p>
The apartment was large and plain; the windows
afforded a view of the mighty valley of the Clyde;
the furniture consisted of thirty hard-seated Windsor
chairs, a long mahogany table, and side tables strewed
with newspapers and dog-eared army-lists.  Over the
mantelpiece hung an engraved portrait of Sir Colin
Campbell, General of the Highland Division, and a
row of enormous stags' antlers and skulls.
</p>

<p>
A handsome, but elderly man, with grizzled hair,
becoming slightly bald, and having an obstinate
moustache that despised bandoline and defied all trimming,
and having a face browned by every climate under
heaven, was seated on one chair, while his spurred
heels rested on another.  He was immersed in the
pages of the 'U.S. Gazette.'  He wore green tartan
trews and a red shell-jacket, with a sash over his left
shoulder; a plain Highland bonnet and a splendidly
jewelled dirk lay beside him; and close by was a
decanter of peculiar mess port, a glass of which he
set down with a glance of surprise as Callum and I,
after the preliminary <i>single knock</i> on the door, were
ushered in by the mess-waiter.
</p>

<p>
This officer was Colonel Ronald Crawford, who
distinguished himself so much in India, and of whom
it was often said, that he was so brave and cool, that
he would not have winked even if a cannon ball had
shaved his whiskers.  He bowed politely to me&mdash;looked
inquisitively at Callum, who he no doubt supposed
to be a recruit, and whose tattered mountain
garb was somewhat remarkable.  He stood
dutifully, bonnet in hand, about a yard behind me,
eying the colonel dubiously, as he might have eyed
an ogre.
</p>

<p>
'I believe I have the honour to address Colonel
Crawford of the &mdash;th Highlanders,' said I.
</p>

<p>
'The same at your service,' said the colonel,
rising, planting his feet astride, and placing his back
to the fire&mdash;a favourite professional attitude.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Allan Mac Innon,' said I, introducing myself
with timid anxiety.
</p>

<p>
The colonel bowed again, and said, blandly,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'In what can I serve you, Mr. Mac Innon?'
</p>

<p>
My story was briefly told, and he listened with
considerable interest, for he was too brave in heart to
hear it without emotion.
</p>

<p>
'Your name is Mac Innon, and your father was,
you mention, in the &mdash;th Highlanders.  Did he serve
once with the 1st Royal Scots?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, in the war against the Pindarees, and fought
at the battle of Nagpore and the storming of Gawelghur.'
</p>

<p>
'I knew him, my lad, I knew him well,' said the
old Colonel, pressing both my hands in his; 'God
bless me, but this is strange!  And you are the son of
old Allan Mac Innon of the Royals!&mdash;He saved my
life at Nagpore&mdash;.'
</p>

<p>
'Then <i>you</i> are the officer, to save whom he made
such a desperate effort at the head of thirty men of
the Royals, and whom he found tied to the muzzle of
a brass gun, which was loaded&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'With round shot and grape, my boy! but he saved
me, by cleaving with one blow of his sword the
rascally Arab who was about to apply the match that
would have blown me to shreds!  This was just
within the Durawazza gate, when poor Jack Bell of
ours, with a company of the Royal Scots and a party
of Sappers, stormed it.  Bless my soul! and you are
really the son of my old chum and comrade, Allan
Mac Innon?  Drink your wine, my lad, and tell me
all this once again.'
</p>

<p>
In ten minutes we were quite old friends; another
decanter of port was ordered up, Callum was consigned
to the care of the mess-waiter, and then I made
known my wishes to the colonel, who began
alternately to smile and look a little perplexed.
</p>

<p>
'You wish a commission&mdash;we are now at war to
be sure; but there are many difficulties.  Have you
any interest?'
</p>

<p>
'None&mdash;all who might have served me have died
in the army.'
</p>

<p>
'You cannot purchase?'
</p>

<p>
'I have not quite twenty guineas in the world.'
</p>

<p>
'Bless my soul!  Then there are the necessary
studies&mdash;a curriculum in fact&mdash;an examination and
cramming at Sandhurst.  What languages do you
know?'
</p>

<p>
'English, a little French, and Gaelic.'
</p>

<p>
The old colonel burst into a fit of laughter.
</p>

<p>
'Come&mdash;I like this!  Did your father purchase?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'Then how did he join the Black Watch?'
</p>

<p>
'By bringing two hundred men to its ranks.'
</p>

<p>
'We are making the regiment up to two battalions&mdash;the
full war establishment; if, among your emigrants
you could procure as many volunteers as would
entitle you to an ensigncy&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'How many are required?'
</p>

<p>
'Five and twenty,'
</p>

<p>
'I can bring you that very number!' said I, rising
and seizing my bonnet.
</p>

<p>
'Nay, not so fast,' said the colonel, laughing, and
filling my glass again.  'Will they all pass the
doctor's examination?'
</p>

<p>
'They are the flower of the district&mdash;strong, hardy,
and athletic men,' I replied, as the wine mounted
into my head; 'men inured to a life of poverty and
toil; men who with no other covering than their kilt
and plaid have remained upon the frozen heather
and in the open air for weeks together, to stalk the
wild red deer; men who with a single bullet will kill
a hawk or eagle in full flight, or bring the most
furious stag to bay&mdash;ay and slay it too, by one
stroke of a skene-dhu or a clubbed rifle!'
</p>

<p>
'Bravo! this is the stuff to make soldiers of!  Instead
of five and twenty, I wish you had five hundred
such, <i>cho laidir Re Cuchullin</i>&mdash;as strong as the Fingalian.
You see, my lad, I don't forget my Gaelic.'
</p>

<p>
'The day will never come again, when five hundred
such men will march from the Braes of Loch
Ora, colonel.'
</p>

<p>
He invited me to dine that day at the mess, where
the splendor of the plate, the richness of the
Highland uniforms, the various wines, the number and
delicacy of the dishes, with the kindness and frank
good-fellowship of the officers, charmed and dazzled
me; and as they were all passionately fond of sporting,
shooting, and deer-stalking, topics in which I was
quite at home, I conversed about them with an ease,
energy, and confidence which&mdash;when I forgot the
pink champagne&mdash;certainly surprised myself.
</p>

<p>
Anxious to have his battalion made up without
delay, the colonel had already written to the Horse
Guards about me: bounties were high, and men were
scarce; my twenty-five volunteers were ready and
willing, and an answer was expected from the
General Commanding-in-Chief within eight days.
</p>

<p>
The night was far advanced before I left the castle.
</p>

<p>
Full of new thoughts, new hopes, and new life, my
whole horizon seemed to have become suddenly
cloudless, bright, and sunny; Laura's beautiful eyes
were before me, and amid the mellowing influences
of the moonlight and the mess champagne, nothing
seemed impossible for me to achieve, and I felt happy,
confident, and glorious.
</p>

<p>
The moon shone with silver splendor on the broad
expanse of the Clyde, and far across its bosom threw
the shadow of Dumbarton's double peak.  To me
there seemed but one dark spot in the landscape&mdash;the
large emigrant ship, which lay at anchor in the
stream&mdash;the <i>Duchess</i>, which was to convey our poor
and expatriated people to their new homes in the Land
of the West.
</p>

<p>
I will hasten over <i>their</i> departure to America; the
sailing of the vessel was hurried next day, and they
were thrust on board pell-mell, like sheep.  I will
not attempt to describe the parting between them
and the twenty-five who volunteered to share my
fortune in the old world, rather than become the
pioneers of civilization and the patriarchs of another
race in the western hemisphere.  Callum and Minnie
parted for the time, with the usual promises of
constancy, of remembrance, and of writing until they
met again, for she would not leave her relations to
become the wife of a soldier&mdash;and so we all separated.
</p>

<p>
Alisdair Mac Gouran and the older of the
expatriated, were full of many misgivings; but aged
people always are so; and the shrill cry of sorrow
and farewell which ascended from that crowded deck
as the fore-yard was filled, and when the anchor was
apeak, went to my heart like a dagger.  The elders
of the tribe, whose tastes, habits, and thoughts were
bounded by the narrow horizon of their native glen,
were naturally filled with consternation by the idea
of the new and far-off land of their labours and eternal
rest; but I now felt a fresh hope&mdash;a new joy springing
up within me, as the love of adventure and the
consciousness of freedom, so dear to a young and
buoyant heart, roused my energies and my enthusiasm,
and I now longed for the hour when I should belt
on my sword, with the world for my home, and the
colours for my household gods.
</p>

<p>
I will refrain from detailing the cruelties and
barbarities to which, in their outward voyage, the
last of the clan were subjected; how they were
decimated by starvation and fever; how the old perished
daily and the young lost health and heart together;
and how the aged Mhari and the young and blooming
Minnie died off the foggy Bank of Newfoundland.
On board the <i>Duchess</i> a small allowance of meal with
a liberal quantity of brackish water was their daily
food; but than they were amply furnished with
anti-slavery tracts, Addresses to the Women of America,
and shilling copies of Uncle Tom's Cabin.
</p>

<p>
Whether or not it is owing to the apathy or
incapacity of the man&mdash;the solitary man&mdash;the supposed
legal and diplomatic Briareus, to whom the government
of Scotland is intrusted, or to the utter ignorance
of that country betrayed by British legislators,
that the sufferings of our Celts arise, I pretend not to
say.  The fault lies somewhere.
</p>

<p>
Ignorance of Scottish affairs and of Scottish wants
and wishes, together with the criminal apathy of
Scottish representatives and the overwhelming
influence of centralization, are doubtless the cause of
much of the misery and ruin of the Highland
population; and the day may come when Britain will
find the breasts and bayonets of her foreign legionaries,
or the effeminate rabble of her manufacturing
cities, but a poor substitute for the stubborn clansmen
of Sutherland, Ross-shire, and Breadalbane.

CHAPTER XXVIII.
<br /><br />
MY REGIMENT.
</h3>

<p>
'To be Ensigns in the 2nd battalion of the &mdash;
Highlanders, Allan Mac Innon, Gent., and John Belton,
Gent., vice Dowb, promoted to the Turkish
Contingent.'
</p>

<p>
Such was the announcement which I read in a
Gazette sent to my lodgings one morning, about a
fortnight after my first interview with Colonel
Crawford.  I now ceased to be 'gent.' in any sense of the
word, and found myself in one day a full-blown ensign,
with a fortune of 5<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per diem, and a passport
to go where glory invited me, in the shape of
whistling-dicks and Minie-rifles.
</p>

<p>
Thus, thanks to the faith and love borne me by
twenty-five peasant lads of Glen Ora, now all duly
attested and accepted soldiers, I had surmounted the
barriers of interest at the Horse Guards; the necessity
of pounding 500<i>1.</i> with Cox and Co., the puzzling,
cramming, and quizzing at Sandhurst, with a hundred
minor annoyances.
</p>

<p>
Let the reader suppose my subscription to band-fund,
mess-plate, and commission fees all paid&mdash;three
trifles amounting to twenty-one guineas, by which
one's first three months' pay is legally borrowed
under the Royal authority; let the reader imagine
my outfit procured&mdash;my uniform, camp-equipage,
canteen, iron-bedstead, et cetera, provided&mdash;and all
to be paid for by Providence, or the plunder of Sebastopol,
if the aforesaid 5<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> failed to do so&mdash;and
behold me, then, an ensign in a 'crack regiment,'
and like Don Juan&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Made up by youth, by love, and by an army tailor.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In less than a month I was reported fit for duty,
and joined my company, into which the colonel had
kindly enrolled my twenty-five Mac Innons.  I had
applied myself with such assiduity to the mysteries
of the goose-step, the right half-face, the left
half-face, and the right-about three-quarters-face, &amp;c.,
that I gained the respect of that dread man the
adjutant, and the profound esteem of the various sergeants
to whom I was handed over in succession to acquire
the manual and platoon exercises, the use of the club
and broadsword, and to each of whom, at parting, the
'tip' of two days' pay was necessary.  I soon won,
too, the entire confidence of our brave old colonel,
who, in kindness and advice, acted to me more as a
father than a friend.
</p>

<p>
Great was the change this month had achieved in
my fortunes!  In that brief time I had seen our
dwellings levelled to the earth! the glen, which had
been peopled for ages, laid desolate and bare; the
muirs consumed by fire, and all the land reduced
to a voiceless solitude.  My mother was lying far
away in her quiet grave&mdash;her old familiar face was
gone for ever: I was separated from Laura, and was
now a soldier, like my forefathers, with the wide
world all before me.
</p>

<p>
Of John Belton, who was gazetted at the same time
with myself, and who became one of my chief friends,
I shall speak frequently anon.  He was a handsome,
lively, and light-hearted fellow, and we were a pair
of inseparables; but with all the charms of the new
life that had so suddenly opened before me, I was
far from happy still.
</p>

<p>
After long thought, anxiety, and careful consideration,
with a heart inspired by love and hope, I ventured
to write a timid letter to Laura, expressing my
admiration, my esteem, and undying regard for her,
all of which were strengthened by the knowledge
that an early and greater separation was at hand, as
the regiment to which I had been appointed was
warring in the East, and I added, that in leaving her,
more than probably for ever, all my hopes and prayers
were for her happiness.
</p>

<p>
Cæsar, on the night before the great battle of
Pharsalia, was not more full of thought than I, while
penning this letter to little Laura Everingham.
</p>

<p>
I dared not ask her to write to me, yet I hoped she
might do so; indeed, for some days, I was certain she
would reply.  I knew that she would write politely,
kindly, timidly, and perhaps with some formality;
but I longed to gaze upon the lines her pretty hand
had traced.  It would be a relic of her&mdash;a souvenir
of buried hopes and futile aspirations, when other
days would come.
</p>

<p>
But day after day passed&mdash;a week elapsed&mdash;then, a
fortnight, and yet no letter came; and daily, while
every pulse quickened with anxiety, I watched the
pipe-major (who acted as our regimental postman)
distributing his letters on parade; but, alas! none
ever came for me.
</p>

<p>
My courage fell&mdash;day succeeded day, and still no
letter.  Then hope began to die; my nights were
dreamy or sleepless, and my days full of gnawing
suspense.  Could Laura be ill?&mdash;then Fanny would
write.  Had she dismissed me from her mind? or
had Sir Horace intercepted the letter?  Thus I
wearied myself with conjectures.  Should I write to her
again?  Pride said 'no;' yet that very pride which
sprang from wounded self-esteem was rendered the
more bitter by its struggle with much of honest
tenderness, pure regard, and sincere regret that one I
loved so well should treat me with such cutting
coldness and neglect.
</p>

<p>
I endured six weeks of much chagrin and suspense
after writing that unlucky letter from Dumbarton;
but at last a crisis was put to my artificial affliction.
</p>

<p>
One day Captain Clavering made his appearance at
mess, in mufti; he was the guest of Colonel
Crawford, and expressed so much real pleasure and
satisfaction at meeting me again, that he quite won me
by his frankness.  He even went the length of
offering me the use of his purse, saying that I might
repay him at any time&mdash;whenever it suited me to
do so.
</p>

<p>
'I know deuced well, my dear fellow, what it is to
be under orders for foreign service, having once had
the misfortune to be in the Line,' said he, 'and to
have only five shillings and threepence per diem, to
find myself in messing, clothing, servant and
servant's livery, camp-equipage, and everything.
Snobleigh of ours&mdash;languid as ever&mdash;has lost a devil of a
bet on the Oaks, and has rejoined the Guards at
Windsor.  Fanny, my sister, is as Lola
Montes&mdash;looking as ever.  Sir Horace&mdash;you asked for Sir
Horace&mdash;he is quite well and hearty; busy about his
new shooting-box in Glen Ora; and Laura&mdash;oh
Laura is more charming than ever, and full of
anticipated happiness.'
</p>

<p>
As he said this, he stroked his black moustache,
and gave me one of the most knowing little winks;
and it scorned to convey so much, though I knew not
what, that pique fettered my tongue, and a vague
sentiment of jealousy filled my heart.
</p>

<p>
'He is a fine fellow Clavering,' said the colonel,
in a low voice, to me;&mdash;'glad to see you know him.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah&mdash;yes&mdash;he is quite an old friend,' I replied,
while fixing my gaze on a diamond-and-pearl ring he
wore on the engaged finger, and which I recognized
to have been worn by Laura.
</p>

<p>
'I knew his brother well&mdash;poor Bob Clavering, of
the 5th&mdash;the Northumberland Fusileers,' said
Brevet-Major Duncan Catanagh, the captain of our
Grenadiers, a dark-visaged, rough, and black-bearded
soldier; 'and I had the narrowest escape in the
world on the day he was killed.'
</p>

<p>
'How?' asked several.
</p>

<p>
'We were both wounded in the action of Maheidpoor,
in the Mahratta war, and, with six others, were
being conveyed from the field next day in a waggon:
the sun was blazing hot&mdash;ay, hot as fire!  Our wounds
were undressed; we were half dead of thirst, and the
jolting of the vehicle increased our sufferings to such
a degree that I left it, resolving to die quietly by the
road side rather than endure such misery longer.
The waggon was then being drawn along a road
which wound close to the abrupt brow of a tremendous
precipice, and in one minute after I stepped
out, the horses became restive, plunged and
reared&mdash;the waggon went backward, and toppled over the
rocks into the valley, three hundred feet below, where
the horses, wheels, and framework, with my five
miserable companions, were dashed to pieces!  I thought
little of my escape then&mdash;but it has often come
painfully before me since.  Tom Clavering came into a
handsome fortune by that little <i>malheur</i>, and at once
exchanged from the 5th to the Grenadier Guards.'
</p>

<p>
'And the Mahrattas?' said Belton.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, they would soon have finished me,' said
Catanagh, 'but for the exertions of a cunning old
Brahmin, who saved my life, and smuggled me to
Murray Mac Gregor's head-quarters, when he held
Poonah with only the Scots Royals against all the
thousands of Ras Holkar.'
</p>

<p>
'Poonah,' said the old colonel, laughing, 'that was
where you had such a long flirtation with a pretty
widow, whose husband, a lieutenant of the 5th, had
been blown from the mouth of a mortar by the
Mahrattas&mdash;eh?'
</p>

<p>
'Not at all&mdash;but pass the wine,' replied Catanagh,
laughing and reddening a little; 'besides, we speak
of flirtation with an unmarried female&mdash;one's cousin,
for instance&mdash;but with a widow, it assumes a&mdash;a&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'A deeper character,' suggested the colonel.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;we then call it a <i>liaison</i>,' said Clavering,
who had retired to an open window and lighted a
cigar.
</p>

<p>
'Clavering is in high spirits&mdash;'gad, the fellow's
like champagne!' said Catanagh.
</p>

<p>
'For the best of reasons,' whispered the colonel,
whose voice went through me like a galvanic shock;
'he is about to be <i>married</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed,' I rejoined, a desperate air of coolness
struggling with the painful interest this communication
excited within me; 'to whom may I ask?'
</p>

<p>
'A charming young girl&mdash;Miss Everingham&mdash;daughter
and heiress of Sir Horace Everingham, the
Conservative M.P., who bought an estate in the
Highlands lately.'
</p>

<p>
The poor colonel smiled pleasantly and confidentially
as he said this, all unconscious that he was
planting a dagger in his listener's heart.
</p>

<p>
'By Jove, he will have something handsome with
her,' said Ewan Mac Pherson, the captain of our
Light Company; 'Elton Hall is a magnificent place,
and then the Highland property&mdash;but when does the
little affair come off?'
</p>

<p>
'When he returns from the Crimea,' said Belton.
</p>

<p>
'The deuce&mdash;from the Crimea!'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, pardon me,' said the colonel; 'he is to be
married almost immediately, and is now <i>en route</i> to
Edinburgh after some of the little necessary
arrangements.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course&mdash;there will be the bride's <i>trousseau</i> to
order at a fashionable <i>magazin des modes</i>&mdash;the usual
case of jewels&mdash;the twelve morning and evening
dresses&mdash;the four dozen of everything necessary for
ladies fair.  Thank heaven, my marching luggage
never consisted of more than a portmanteau, an
epaulette-box, and a boot-jack.'
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps so, Catanagh,' replied the bantering
colonel; 'but little Laura Everingham, with her
English acres and funded property, is a better prize
than our Poonah widow, with all her rupees and
indigo; and drinking iced champagne at Elton Hall
will be better than eating chutney and pickled
monkey, with the thermometer at 104° in the shade&mdash;the
punkah out of order, and not a breath of air to be
had for love or for money.  Pass the claret: gentlemen,
fill your glasses&mdash;we will drink to my friend Captain
Clavering, of the Grenadier Guards&mdash;happiness to
him!'
</p>

<p>
The wine almost choked me; but mastering my
emotion, I left the mess-room, and sought my quarters.
There I tore off my red coat, for it seemed to
stifle me.  I threw myself upon my bed in an agony
of mind difficult to portray&mdash;an agony such as we
feel but once in a life-time; and I strove to be
calm&mdash;to think&mdash;to reflect, and to realize all that the
colonel had said so heedlessly, but yet so innocently,
to torture me.
</p>

<p>
One fact stood palpably and painfully before me:
Laura Everingham was lost to me for ever!  It
was, perhaps, a just punishment for the vanity and
presumption&mdash;or the folly&mdash;with which I had permitted
a fervent and enthusiastic heart to give full
scope to a love which it fostered in defiance of reason
and of hope.  The tenor of the conversation I had
overheard in the arbour occurred to me again and
again.  I endeavoured to analyze it.  To me, there
now seemed too much lightness of heart and of
expression in Laura, when on the eve of a hopeless
separation from one whom she knew to love her so
well&mdash;one then so humbled, so crushed and ruined as
I&mdash;but perhaps she could not have acted otherwise
without exciting still more the suspicion and the
ridicule of Fanny Clavering.  Were her words to be
considered as really indicative of her secret thoughts?
Moreover, what claim had I, so poor in all this world's
gifts and gear, on one so rich in all the gifts of heaven
and earth?  None.  Nor was she to blame for the
secret love I had nourished and fostered in my heart
since the first moment of our acquaintance.  Yet her
silence, her pallor, her deep unspoken emotion when
I left her, would seem to say that I was not without
an interest in her heart.  May she not, thought I,
have wept for me, and prayed for me, on the midnight
pillow, even as I, all lonely and unseen, had sighed
and prayed for her?
</p>

<p>
No&mdash;no; the light had vanished at last, and Laura
was for ever lost to me&mdash;a just punishment to one of
the wildest fancies that ever warmed a romantic
heart.  The pearl ring, with a thousand 'trifles light
as air,' came in all their bitter, blighting strength, to
confirm the news of Clavering's marriage, and,
covering my face with my hands, I wept like a child.
Until that burning hour I knew not the depth of my
hopeless passion, or how much I had really loved
Miss Everingham.
</p>

<p>
The night was a miserable one to me, but it passed
away like others; and the sharp brass drum, and
then the yelling war-pipe, as they rang in the early
morning air, waking the deep echoes of 'Balclutha's
walls of rock,' announced that 'to march' was now
the order; and first Jack Belton, and then Callum
Dhu, burst breathlessly into my room.
</p>

<p>
'What the deuce&mdash;why the champagne must have
been strong last night,' exclaimed Jack, on seeing me
lying on my bed, and not in it; 'come, my boy&mdash;bustle
up&mdash;turn out&mdash;the route has come!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>The route</i>&mdash;for where?'
</p>

<p>
'The East,' cried he, flinging his cap up to the
ceiling.

CHAPTER XXIX.
<br /><br />
THE ROUTE&mdash;WE SAIL.
</h3>

<p>
'The <i>route</i>&mdash;the <i>route</i> has come!'  What a commotion
that momentous announcement makes in the little
world of a barrack, as it passes from mouth to
mouth&mdash;from the commanding officer to the adjutant, and
from that indefatigable vizier to the sergeant-major&mdash;from
mouth to mouth, and room to room!
</p>

<p>
This important document, fresh under the seal of
the Adjutant-General's office at Edinburgh, stated in
usual form, that 'it was Her Majesty's pleasure that
one field officer, two captains, four subalterns, six
sergeants, three pipers, and two hundred rank and file
of the &mdash;th regiment of Highlanders be held in
readiness to march at such a time, as may be judged
expedient, from the castle of Dumbarton, and to
embark on board such tonnage as may be provided for
their reception, and conveyance <i>to Constantinople</i>.'
</p>

<p>
The field-officer was our rough and bearded Major
Duncan Catanagh, K.H.; the captains were Mac
Pherson and Logan; the subalterns, Lieutenants
Rigg and Johnstone, with two ensigns&mdash;viz., Jack
Belton and myself.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Vestal</i>, formerly a donkey-frigate of twenty-six
guns, but now, cut, lengthened, and fitted with
a screw-propeller, and transmogrified into a troop-ship,
lay off Dumbarton, with her top-sails loose and
blue-peter at the fore-mast head.
</p>

<p>
We embarked next day.  I remember how much I
was impressed by the service-like aspect of our chosen
two hundred, who were to join our first battalion&mdash;all
with their bonnets cased in oil-skins; their white
gaiters on; their great-coats rolled on the top of their
packs; their haversacks and wooden canteens slung
above their accoutrements, as they paraded in the
grey light of the early morning, when the sun was
yet below the hills, and when the shrill 'gathering,'
woke the echoes of dark and shadowy Dumbarton.
</p>

<p>
On the roll being called, one of our men, Lance-corporal
Donald Roy, was reported to be absent.
</p>

<p>
'Absent,' reiterated the adjutant; 'devilish odd&mdash;were
not all the men of this detachment confined to
barracks immediately on the route arriving?
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sir&mdash;but Donald is not here.'
</p>

<p>
Under his moustache, the adjutant muttered
something that sounded very much like an oath.
</p>

<p>
'This looks ill,' said he, reddening with anger; 'a
fellow bolts on the eve of embarking for foreign
service!  The sergeant of the main guard and the
sentries at the gate must be accountable for this.'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, I alone am answerable,' said Major Catanagh;
'Donald comes from my native glen on the west bank
of Loch Lomond; and late on the night the route
arrived, he came to me and said, "Major, <i>you</i> know
me well&mdash;you have known me since we were boys,
and can trust me.  My mother died when we were
fighting on the banks of the Indus, and she is buried
in the auld kirkyard of Luss; get me leave for a
night, that I may cross the hills to say one prayer at
her grave before we go, and I swear by the God that
hears me to be at Dumbarton gate before you march&mdash;ay
before the pipes play reveille."'
</p>

<p>
'And you obtained leave for him from the colonel?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Reveille was blown long since,' said the adjutant,
with an incredulous smile, 'and Donald has not yet
appeared.  Sergeant Mac Ildhui, mark him <i>absent</i> in
the Report.'
</p>

<p>
The kind major reddened in turn, for our adjutant
was a Lowlander, and did not believe in Highlanders;
but Catanagh was a Celt, and better knew the missing
man.
</p>

<p>
'I will answer for him,' said he; 'Donald will be
back in time, I warrant him&mdash;where are his musket,
pack, and accoutrements.'
</p>

<p>
'They are carried by his comrades.'
</p>

<p>
The hour for marching drew near; already the
boats of the <i>Vestal</i> awaited us; but there was no
appearance of Donald Roy, so the 'next man for duty,'
was ordered to prepare to take his place.
</p>

<p>
The women had been balloted for at the drum-head;
the two fortunate wives who were to accompany
us were clinging in joy to their husbands' necks.
The unfortunates who had drawn <i>blanks</i> were filling
the barrack square with noisy lamentations.  Adieux
had been said, and hands shaken.  Then the little
column broke into sections of threes, and with the
whole band of the battalion in our front, playing
'Lochaber no more,' and accompanied by our
comrades' cheering, we left the ancient castle of
Dumbarton just as the sun rose, and marched towards the
landing-place.
</p>

<p>
As we proceeded to the bank of the river, a soldier,
pale and breathless, dashed into our ranks, raised his
hand to his bonnet, and cried aloud,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Major Catanagh&mdash;I am here!'
</p>

<p>
'Donald Roy!' exclaimed the soldiers with satisfaction,
for this man was a favourite with all, and
moreover was a famous sword-player and tosser of
the caber.
</p>

<p>
'I knew that you would return, Donald,' said the
major, with an approving smile.
</p>

<p>
'I have travelled day and night, running like a
deer, Major Catanagh,' replied the soldier in a rapid
whisper; 'I have had twelve miles to go, and as
many to return; but I am young and active, and the
ardour of grief bore me up, for I was determined to
see the grave of my mother before I left my native
place, perhaps for ever; and may heaven bless you,
major, for the trust you have put in me.  I am
poor&mdash;but I never deceived any one.  Oh, major, I have
seen the woods of Cameron, the rocks of Ross-dhu,
and the wilds of Rowardennan, places that you and I
know well&mdash;but may never look upon again.'
</p>

<p>
'We shall, Donald&mdash;please God, we shall both see
them again,' said Catanagh, with kindling eyes.
</p>

<p>
With kindly interest I looked on this pale and
weary soldier, who spoke in my native Gaelic; but I
had soon other thoughts in my heart, and in the
ardour and excitement of embarking for foreign service
and the seat of war, with the brattle of the drum
and the blare of the brass band playing a stirring
Scottish quick-step; the tread of marching feet, and
the gleam of fixed bayonets round me, I was soon
beyond the reach of tender or soft impressions.
</p>

<p>
The steam continued to roar at times through the
safety-valve; the band continued to play, and our
comrades to cheer, as our detachment went off in
boat-loads to the <i>Vestal</i>, which was rapidly getting
up all her horse-power.  Her white canvas hung
loose aloft, and her decks were crowded by groups
of the sombre rifles below; but until I stood upon
her poop and looked round me, I could scarcely
realise the truth of my position, or that all this
new phase of life, so strange to me, was not a
dream.
</p>

<p>
The sun came up in his glory from the morning sea;
the blue waters rolled around us in light, and curled
their crested waves before the soft west wind.  The
huge dark shadows of Balclutha's double Dun fell far
along the azure bosom of the Clyde, when the
steamer's anchor was apeak, and the propeller began
to dash the water into foam astern, making a sweep
of nearly twenty feet at each impetuous turn, and
objects on the beach began to lessen, change or pass
each other, and we stood in groups looking at the
fading mountains few of us might ever see again.
</p>

<p>
Summer had passed away with all its bloom and
verdure; no longer laden with rosy blossoms,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Fruitful Clydesdale's apple bowers<br />
  Were mellowing in the moon;'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
the peach and the nectarine had glowed there in
clusters and been gathered, and now the woods of
leafy green were being tinged by russet brown and
golden yellow.
</p>

<p>
On leaving the mouth of the Clyde, we found the
water rough; the wind blew keenly and chopped
about; thus the <i>Vestal</i> pitched and lurched heavily
off Ailsa Craig, amid the mist and spray.  This
somewhat damped the military pride of the youngsters,
and as the motion increased when we entered the
North Channel, the very idea of breakfast or dinner
excited a qualmy horror within me; and the jokes of
Catanagh, Mac Pherson, and other older soldiers, failed
to rouse my spirit either to fun or anger&mdash;in short I
was sick, miserably sick, and would gladly have
exchanged my hopes of a marshal's baton and a tomb in
Westminster for a safe footing on the nearest point
of land.
</p>

<p>
On, on we sped, and ere long a faint white line at
the horizon marked where the chalky brows of the
Land's-end faded into the evening sea, and we bade
'a long good night to old England.'
</p>

<p>
We had on board six companies of the Rifle Brigade&mdash;all
jolly fellows; and on recovering our 'sea legs,'
we found the hours pass delightfully.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Vestal</i> was commanded by John Crank, an old,
fiery, passionate and red-faced naval lieutenant, who
had served under Nelson as a middy, and lost his
'starboard toplight, when boarding the <i>Holy Joe</i>,' as
he irreverently named the <i>San Josef</i>.
</p>

<p>
The proportion of tonnage for troops in a transport
is two tons per soldier; but on board our old donkey
<i>Vestal</i>, the Highlanders were stowed away with only
eighteen inches per man for sleeping-room; and as
the weather grew warm on our approaching the
Mediterranean, they suffered great discomfort&mdash;and
the poor women were crammed away among the rank
and file, unheeded and uncared for by all but their
husbands.
</p>

<p>
I was subaltern of the watch, on the morning we
anchored off Gibraltar, where we remained for four
and twenty hours, waiting for despatches direct from
London.  As soon as they arrived, the mail was
transferred on board the <i>Vestal</i>; the steam was again
got up, and long before evening, the giant peak, the
tremendous rock-built batteries of Gibel-al-taric&mdash;the
rock of the old Moorish wars&mdash;faded into the blue
waters as we bore on towards that land of death and
battle, suffering and disaster, where Britannia was
exchanging her ancient oak leaves and laurels for the
funeral cypress and the baleful yew.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXX.
<br /><br />
THE TROOP-SHIP.
</h3>

<p>
Among the letters and papers which reached our
detachment at Gibraltar, was a copy of the 'Morning
Post,' which went 'the round' of the
officers&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>&mdash;was perused by all in turn.
</p>

<p>
We were all seated jovially at the table, in the
harbour of Gibraltar; the bright sun was glistening
on the waves which ran in long and glassy ripples
through the straits; the cabin-windows were open;
the cloth had been removed, and the decanters of
sherry and full-bodied old port were travelling round
the well-polished mahogany on their patent silver
waggons.  We were idling over nuts and peaches,
talking, laughing and making merry on the prospects
of the war, when, judge of my emotions, on Major
Catanagh, who had entrenched himself behind the
open pages of the 'Morning Post,' suddenly raising
his head and his voice together&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Poor Tom Clavering!' he exclaimed; 'he has come
to an untimely end at last.'
</p>

<p>
'How?' asked several, pausing in their conversation;
'Clavering of the Guards&mdash;who dined with us
at Dumbarton?'
</p>

<p>
'Brother of Bob Clavering of the 5th?  Well?'
</p>

<p>
'He has come to an untimely end,' continued the
major, and my heart felt a pang as the captain's
frank and handsome face came before me; but I
could neither analyse the major's expression of eye,
or my own emotions, as he added,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'He has gone the way we must all go.'
</p>

<p>
'Dead!' I exclaimed, as hope mingled with my
regret.
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;married.'
</p>

<p>
'Married!' echoed several voices.
</p>

<p>
'As you will hear by this most magniloquent
paragraph.'
</p>

<p>
'Read it, major&mdash;all news from home are welcome,'
said Jack Belton.
</p>

<p>
'Married yesterday by the Lord Bishop of Edinburgh.&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Who the deuce is he?' asked some one; 'we
don't know such dignitaries in Scotland.'
</p>

<p>
'Never mind, my boy&mdash;the "Morning Post" does&mdash;Married
yesterday, by the Lord Bishop of Edinburgh,
Captain Thomas Clavering, second son of the late
Sir Anthony Clavering, of Clavering-corbet and
Belgrave-square, to Laura, the only and accomplished
daughter of Sir Horace Everingham, Bart, and M.P.,
of Elton Hall, Yorkshire and Glen Ora.  The bride
was most elegantly attired in white glacé silk, covered
with Brussels lace flounces, flowers and a magnificent
Brussels lace veil entwined with white roses and
orange blossom.  She was attended by twelve charming
bridesmaids richly arrayed&mdash;six in pink and six
in white, who unbound their bouquets and strewed
the way with flowers before the wedded pair, from
the porch of St. John's church to the steps of the
carriage.'
</p>

<p>
'By Jove! there's a peal of bells for you!' said
Belton.'
</p>

<p>
'Think of Tom Clavering having the way before
him strewed with flowers.'
</p>

<p>
'After the ceremony, Sir Horace gave a splendid
<i>déjeuner</i> at his residence in Edinburgh, and at four
o'clock the beautiful bride and gallant bridegroom
left town, <i>en route</i> for London, from whence it is said
they will follow the Guards to the Crimea in the
elegant yacht of Augustus Frederick Snobleigh, Esq.,
or in the <i>Fairy Bell</i>, the well-known yacht of Sir
Horace.'
</p>

<p>
This pompous and inflated notice, which excited
much merriment at the mess-table, fell heavily and
sorely on me.  Every word of it was like a
death-knell&mdash;yet I loitered calmly and placidly, as old
Duncan Catanagh read it with a comical smile in his
grey Highland eye, and with a quizzical emphasis on
certain portions of it.  No one who saw me sitting
there, so quietly and so pale (I could perceive my
face in an opposite mirror), would have dreamed
there was such a hell raging in my heart.
</p>

<p>
But alas! this world is full of strange fancies and
misplaced affections.
</p>

<p>
Though I was fully prepared or this marriage,
the notice of it, so plainly and palpably <i>in print</i>, was
a source of great agony to me; but amid the noise
and bustle of the transport, the constant change of
scene in the Mediterranean, and the reckless gaiety
of those around me&mdash;those brave and light hearts,
who amid the mud and gore of the rifle-pits were to
find 'glory or the grave,' I had fortunately little
time left for reflection.  Knowing my secret, and
sympathising with me, honest Jack Belton, left
nothing unsaid or undone to draw me from myself;
to wean me as it were from my own thoughts, and to
fix my attention more on the events that lay before
us than those which were past and irremediable
for Jack's maxim, like his favourite song, was
ever,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'To be sad about trifles is trifling and folly,<br />
  For the true end of life is to live and be jolly.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
All day long, with our revolver pistols, we practised
at bottles or old hats slung from the mainyard
arm; and in this feat none but Callum Dhu could beat
Jack Belton, who had been one of the most successful
pupils in our new school of musketry at Hythe.  In
the evening we had the fine brass band of the Rifles,
who gave us the best airs from <i>Il Travatore</i> and <i>La
Traviata</i>; then we sang glees on the poop, or danced
to the bagpipes on the main-deck, leaving nothing
undone to beguile the tedium of a sea-voyage; for
there <i>is</i> a tedium even in the beautiful Mediterranean;
and daily we exchanged salutes and cheers with
troop-ships and war-steamers, French, British, and
Sardinian, returning with sick and wounded men
from the land towards which we were hastening.
</p>

<p>
Many of these vessels were imperial transports,
on their way to Marseilles; and they had generally
in tow a sailing-vessel, also crowded by the miserable
convalescents of Scutari and Sebastopol; and
hourly, while they were within sight, we saw the
ensign half hoisted, and the dead launched off to
leeward&mdash;sans shroud or coffin or other covering than
their blood-stained uniform, their Zouave cloak, or
grey greatcoat, all tattered and torn by the mud of
the rifle-pits and toil of the trenches.
</p>

<p>
After bidding adieu to the Cape de Gata, that long
ridge of rocks which lie on the eastern limits of
Almeria, and form the last point of Spain, we sighted
Tavolaro, a promontory at the southern extremity of
Sardinia.  On that evening I had some trouble in
saving my irritable follower Callum Dhu from being
put in irons, for beating a rifleman who had been
making fun of his Celtic peculiarities.  On, on, we
sped, with the smoke from our funnel pouring a long
and vapory pennant astern.
</p>

<p>
We landed the Rifles at Malta, and took on board
ten pieces of battering-guns&mdash;forty-eight pounders&mdash;for
the Crimea, and ere long saw a gorgeous sunset
deepening on the green Sicilian hills.  In due time
we were among the countless isles of the Greek
archipelago&mdash;the Andælat Denhisa (or sea of islands,
as it is named by the Turks), with the stern and
rocky shore of the Morca frowning on our lee from
the deep azure sky of the Levant.
</p>

<p>
The Ægean was covered with foam, and as we ran
through the narrow strait that divides the charming
isle of Scio from the vast continent of Asia, the sides
of our steamer, the shrouds, our rough coats&mdash;even
our hair and moustaches, were encrusted with salt
from the flying spray, as we sped on past Milo, Hydra,
and other isles of a thousand old classic memories;
and after passing and saluting the castles of the
Dardanelles, bore up for Gallipoli, at thirteen knots an
hour, with full steam, and every sail set that would
draw fore and aft.
</p>

<p>
Let not my readers fear that I am about to afflict
them with a history either of the war or the siege of
Sebastopol, or even with the now-hackneyed description
of Constantinople.  Fortunately for myself, I
never saw either the Malakoff or the Redan, though
my regiment did, to its cost; and though quartered
in its vicinity, duty or destiny prevented me from
seeing much of the far-famed city of Stamboul.  We
have had enough and to spare of the East and Eastern
War of late; thus I mean to confine myself entirely
to my own adventures, which will prove more than
enough to fill my volume, without the introduction
of any extraneous matter.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXI.
<br /><br />
THE REEFS OF PALEGROSSA.
</h3>

<p>
No French girl, waiting for her lover, was ever more
impatient than I to see the enemy, yet it was my fate
never to plough the waters of the Euxine.
</p>

<p>
In company with the <i>Mahmoudieh</i>, a small Osmanli
steam-brig of ten guns, we had left astern the narrow
channel of the Hellespont, and the lights of Gallipoli
had sunk into haze and darkness on our larboard
quarter, as we steamed, but slowly, into the sea of
Marmora.
</p>

<p>
The night, at first, was calm, but intensely dark,
yet on we glided&mdash;on, on&mdash;over the waste of waters,
our almost noiseless speed forming a strange contrast
to the silence and sleep of the hundreds on board,
who were borne forward through the seething foam
and whirling water, as the revolving screw urged on
the sharp-prowed frigate&mdash;an even course before us,
a long white wake of froth astern; no light visible,
save a faint ray near the binnacle, or that red and
dusky gleam which shoots at times upward from the
engine-room, when the iron jaws of the hot furnace
are unclosed for a moment, and a flash of fiery
radiance falls on the mysterious intricacies of the
clanking machinery, and on the dark and swarthy
visages of the engineer and his mates.
</p>

<p>
So thought Belton and I, as we trod the deck together,
cigar in mouth, while gliding over the darkened
waters of the Propontis.
</p>

<p>
Our coal was becoming scarce, for after an hour
the engines almost ceased, and every stitch of canvas
she could carry was set upon the vessel; but this
was continued only for a time, as before midnight a
gale came on, and the sails were rapidly reduced, and
we lost sight of the <i>Mahmoudieh</i>, with her crescent
and lantern glittering at her foremast-head.
</p>

<p>
Jack Belton was officer of the watch, and about
fifty of our men were on deck in their forage-caps and
greatcoats, ready to bear a hand whenever they were
required, in working the ship and general deck duty.
As he scanned the horizon of the dark sea of Marmora,
and saw a peculiar white streak at its utmost
verge, Captain Crank swore a few nautical oaths, and
bent his piercing solitary eye aloft on every yard and
rope and sail, to see, as he said, 'if she drawed
properly.'
</p>

<p>
'What headland is that, now rising like a dark
cloud upon our larboard bow?' I inquired, with
great suavity, as our skipper was not in a mood to be
trifled with.
</p>

<p>
'Cape St. George&mdash;and a d&mdash;ned unpleasant place
it may prove to <i>us</i>, if the wind shifts, and we find it
on our lee,' he answered, in a voice not unlike a
growl, as he turned his red and weather-beaten visage
to windward.  'How's her head?' he snappishly
asked the midshipman of the watch.
</p>

<p>
'East and by north, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'Keep her so, and if the wind veers round, call
me;' and, with a general scowl round about him, he
entered the poop.
</p>

<p>
As the night waxed older, the seamen, who generally
have peculiar and intuitive instincts about the
weather&mdash;mysterious forebodings which they cannot
account for or explain, looked anxiously ahead, as the
dark clouds deepened on our ocean path, and the
hurrying scud tore the foam from the tops of the
lifted billows.  The crew seemed restless, and
gathered together in whispering groups about the
forecastle and lee side of the main deck.
</p>

<p>
'I think we will have a rough night, sir,' said the
middy of the watch, in a low voice, to old Crank, who
had come again upon deck.
</p>

<p>
'And a dangerous one, too,' he answered, adding,
to the chief mate, 'let both watches be kept on deck,
for I don't think it worth their while to turn in now;
double reef the foresail and main-top-sail&mdash;quick,
Mr. Gasket!  Send all the topgallant-yards on
deck&mdash;handsomely a bit&mdash;bravo!  Now make all fast, and
keep a sharp look out there forward.'
</p>

<p>
With these words, and a last glance at the compass,
in the light of which his red face glowed like a
stormy moon, our gallant skipper again descended
from the poop and entered his cabin, to consult the
chart through the mellowing influence of a glass of
stiff brandy grog.
</p>

<p>
At nine o'clock an order had been given to batten
all the port-lids, and ship the dead-lights.
</p>

<p>
These warnings and precautions detained me long,
and somewhat anxiously, on deck, till the bellowing
wind and the bitter spray, which showered over the
ship like rain, fairly drove me below; but knowing
less, or caring less, about the actual risk we ran, after
playing chess for an hour or two with Major Catanagh,
and hearing some prosy old stories about the
Mahrattah war and Bob Clavering of the 5th, I
'turned in,' and wearied by a long day spent in the
keen sea-breeze, after a prayer that Laura might be
happy though she had deserted me for ever, I was
soon fast asleep and dreaming of Sebastopol.
</p>

<p>
From this comfortable state I was suddenly awakened
by a frightful uproar on deck, the bellowing of
the wind through the rigging; the creaking of the
timbers; the grating and straining of the guns in
their lashings; the jarring, swaying, and pitching of
the ship, as she rose on one billow, and plunged
surging deeply into the dark watery trough of
another.  The lamp in my cabin swung madly about in
its brass slings; at last the crystal globe was clashed
to pieces; the light went out, and I was in darkness.
</p>

<p>
I thought of that dreadful storm in the Euxine,
which in the preceding November had nearly destroyed
an entire fleet of transports and store-ships,
strewing the shores of the Crimea with shattered
wrecks and unburied bodies; and with a new
sensation of alarm in my heart, I sprang from bed and
proceeded to dress; at that moment I heard the
excited voice of Jack Belton in the great cabin.
</p>

<p>
'Gentlemen! gentlemen!' cried he, 'turn
out&mdash;breakers are ahead!  Mac Innon&mdash;-Mac
Pherson&mdash;Major, on deck&mdash;on deck, for heaven's sake; the
ship will strike in ten minutes!'
</p>

<p>
The appalling announcement brought every officer
from his cabin in such garments as he could grasp
and don on the instant; and we hurried to the poop.
It was only by clinging to the rail and stanchions
that we could retain our footing on the lofty poop,
over which the white foam was sweeping.  The
waist seemed full of water; the strong cordage bent
or snapped, and streamed about like whipcord; the
foresail, main-topsail, and gib strained and flapped
like thunder, for the ship would not obey her helm;
four men stood by the wheel, and a chaos of darkness,
water, foam, noise, and uproar, were around me; and
I had no distinct impression of anything, but that
our large ship, borne by the stormy wind and furious
current, with all her deck crowded by human beings,
was drifting, at the rate of nine knots an hour,
towards a line of foam ahead, that marked where the
breakers curled on the beach.  But what beach&mdash;whether
it was the classic shore of Roumelia, of Asia
Minor, the Isle of Marmora, or the rocks of Coudouri,
we knew not, for the binnacle, with its compasses,
had been swept away by a wave which made a clean
breach over the ship about midnight, sweeping three
men away, with the poor middy of the watch.
</p>

<p>
The black sky was moonless and starless.
</p>

<p>
I looked upon Major Catanagh, who stood near me
shivering, half clad and clinging to a timber-head,
his grey hair matted to his face by the drifting spray.
Old Duncan was brave as a lion; but he was a
husband&mdash;he was a father, and from the wild black
tumult of the waves that boiled around us&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'His eyes<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were with his heart, and that was far away,'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
in a little cottage half buried among roses and
woodbine, on the western bank of Loch Lomond, where, at
that hour so terrible to him, his poor wife lay perhaps
sleepless on her pillow, listening to the wind that
soughed round the craigs of Ross Dhu, and thinking
of him, with their little ones hushed in dreamless
slumber around her.  Poor Duncan's softer soul was
stirred within him.  His face was pale; his eyes
were stern and sad; and if his spirit quailed in that
awful hour, it was not with fear, for he had faced
death on many a field.
</p>

<p>
Those and those only who have been in such a
place, where every wave swept some brave soul into
eternity, and where every gust of wind bore the cry
of despair and the knell of death, can tell what
Catanagh felt; and I read his thoughts rightly, for
he turned to me abruptly, and warmly pressing my
hand, said,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Thank heaven, Allan, that you have none left
behind you to love or to regret&mdash;none to weep for
you! no wife to leave to the starvation of a widow's
pension&mdash;no puir wee ones to cast upon a cold and
faithless world!'
</p>

<p>
I thought more of Laura than of this thankfulness;
and as my heart swelled with the bitter knowledge
that my fate might never be regretted, all fear and
anxiety died away within it.  I became totally
indifferent, and felt myself really the only unconcerned
spectator present.
</p>

<p>
Callum Dhu having sprung to my side, threw his
strong arm round me, as if to break the force of the
waves which every instant flooded the deck; several
soldiers followed him, and came crowding on the
poop, for as death seemed before us, discipline and
etiquette seemed alike to be forgotten.
</p>

<p>
The rudder chains had given way, and the ship
was driving alternately broadside and stern on,
towards the line of breakers, above which we could
discern the outline of a dark and rocky shore.
</p>

<p>
'She will strike in ten minutes!' cried one of the
mates.
</p>

<p>
The men became excited, and tumultuous cries
ascended from the waist.
</p>

<p>
'Clew up&mdash;cut away the masts&mdash;lower the boats!'
</p>

<p>
Then followed shouts, disputes and struggles for
spars, booms, and hen-coops.
</p>

<p>
'Silence fore and aft&mdash;silence!' cried old Crank,
through his trumpet; 'boatswain, pipe away the
barge and cutter&mdash;be ready to lower away the boats,
man the pumps, and stand by to cut away the masts
the moment she strikes!'
</p>

<p>
'Be cool, Highlanders&mdash;be cool, and fall into your
ranks, my lads!' cried Major Catanagh, perceiving
that the crowding of the soldiers upon the deck
impeded the movements of the seamen; 'fall in here
across the main-deck: bugler sound the
assembly&mdash;sound, my boy.'
</p>

<p>
Long and loudly blew the little bugle-boy the
familiar barrack-yard call, and strangely and wildly,
at that terrible moment, it rang upon the roaring
wind, which seemed to tear the very notes off at the
bugle mouth, and sweep them to leeward with the
hissing foam.
</p>

<p>
'Fall in, my lads&mdash;fall in, and keep in order.  If
the boats can save us, we shall be saved the more
readily by being in order to leave the ship.  If she
splits below us, then we shall die in our ranks like
British soldiers, and like our father's sons&mdash;hoping
everything from a gracious God and fearing nothing.
Remember your discipline, my lads, and keep up
your hearts&mdash;mine has not sunk yet, though like
many among you, I have a dear wife and bairns at
home in Scotland.  Close in, shoulder to shoulder, and
remember the glorious example of Seton and his
Highlanders in the <i>Birkenhead</i>.'
</p>

<p>
A faint hurrah responded to this brief speech, and
like a dark mass in their soaked great coats, the poor
fellows immediately formed in their ranks, four deep
across the deck in front of the poop, where they stood
in silence and in order awaiting either death or
deliverance with that calmness and fortitude for which
no soldiers in Europe can surpass our own braves.
</p>

<p>
I took my place on the left flank, and Callum Dhu
was close beside me, with a coil of rope in his hand,
and a small hen-coop which he had torn from a part
of the ship, and which he defended from all by his
drawn bayonet; but not for his own use or safety.
Amid all the terrors of that awful night, Callum's
whole anxiety was for me.  The crews of the boats
stood by the davits and hoisting-tackles, ready to
lower away on the order being given, though there
was little hope of either cutter, dingy, or whale-boat
living in such a sea.  The well was sounded; and
now we began to hear the clank of the pumps, while
a group of men stood by the masts ready to cut away
everything fore and aft; but the carpenter and his
mates were saved that trouble, for just as the huge
ship surged broadside on among the white breakers,
she gave two fearful lurches&mdash;there was a shock that
made her vibrate from her trucks to her keel, and
snapping like a hazel twig, the strong mainmast,
though built of Meniel fir, and cramped with forty
iron rings, went by the board with a crash like
thunder.
</p>

<p>
The main-topmast of course, and the fore and
mizen-topmasts, with all their debris of yards, ropes,
blocks and chain-sheets, came clattering down in ruin
and confusion among us, killing two men and
wounding others.  The shrouds snapped like threads, and
then all this wilderness of top-hamper was swept
away to leeward, and dashed to shreds upon the rocky
shore.
</p>

<p>
Father Neptune and old Æolus had proved alike
inimical to us, and thus in a moment did our
once-gallant old frigate become a hideous and hopeless
wreck, dismasted, defaced, and bulged upon a coast
unknown.
</p>

<p>
The night was as dark as if we were in the bowels
of the earth; yet from the whiteness of the foam that
covered all the waves which boiled over the ghastly
reef, there came a species of reflected light that
revealed the horrors of our situation.  The wind still
blew furiously in fierce and heavy gusts; drenching
us with spray; yet there stood our little band in
their ranks, orderly and calm, as if upon parade&mdash;brave,
firm, and God-fearing men&mdash;expecting every
instant that the ship would go to pieces!
</p>

<p>
The fall of the masts and top-hamper greatly eased
the <i>Vestal</i>, and she gave no immediate indications of
that general breaking up which we had all so much
reason to dread.
</p>

<p>
'Where are we&mdash;on what coast?' was the question
we asked of each other a hundred times.
</p>

<p>
'Daylight will show,' was the invariable answer,
and watches were impatiently consulted, and the
horizon scanned for the first indication of dawn.  Some
brandy was hoisted up from below; an allowance per
man was served round, and, as old Crank said,
'Never was a raw nip more welcome.'
</p>

<p>
As the wind lulled on the approach of morning,
the sea went down; the spray ceased to deluge the
deck, and we all sought our cabins to procure such
warm and dry clothing as might have escaped the
invasions made by the waves into our premises.
</p>

<p>
A faint streak that glittered along the far verge of
the horizon, marked the quarter of the sky where
the sun would appear, and never was its gleam more
welcome, for now the storm had completely lulled,
and as the ship remained firmly bulged upon the
rock, with her lower hold half filled with water, we
felt ourselves comparatively safe.  An order was
given to lower away the boats; and having now fairly
escaped the horrors of the shipwreck, we began to
look calmly about us.
</p>

<p>
A flood of saffron light spread over the eastern
quarter of the sky; then, radiating like the points of
a mighty star, the sun's rays shot upward and played
upon the dispersing clouds which turned to deep
crimson, and then the sea beneath them seemed to
roll in alternate waves of sapphires and rubies, till
he rose in all his splendour, and then one long and
mighty blaze of dazzling light flashed steadily from
the horizon to the shore, filling with a sunny glory
all the sea of Marmora.
</p>

<p>
Now we could perceive the land distant about a
mile; the shore was green and fertile; to the
eastward rose the towers of an old fortified town, the
domes and tall slender minarets of which were
glittering in the sun.  A little lower down lay a
promontory covered with ruins.  To the westward
was a cape, under the lee of which were a number of
Levantine craft with long lateen-yards that tapered
away aloft, and their striped or brown shoulder-of-mutton
sails, creeping out from the creeks and inlets
where they had found shelter during the squall of the
past night.
</p>

<p>
The carpenter reported, that without powerful
assistance, there was no possibility of getting the ship
off, and as no British, French, or Sardinian steamer
was in sight, Crank stamped about the deck in a high
state of mental excitement and irritation, while fear
of Greek pirates and Natolian robbers, whose armed
boats are ever on the prowl in these seas, made
Catanagh, at his suggestion, order our men to
accoutre and parade with their arms and
ammunition on deck, where an inspection was made, and
our two hundred Highlanders were found to be in
complete fighting order.
</p>

<p>
'What say you now, Captain?' asked Catanagh;
'do you know the coast?'
</p>

<p>
'Only too well, Major&mdash;it is Roumelia, and we are
in the gulf of Salonica.'
</p>

<p>
'That town on the promontory&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Is Heraclea, with the ruins of some old devilish
Greek place close by.'
</p>

<p>
'Then we are on classic ground?'
</p>

<p>
'Damned deal too classic for my taste!' grumbled
Crank; 'we are ashore, sir, on the Palegrossa rocks.'
</p>

<p>
'Is there a Turkish garrison in Heraclea?'
</p>

<p>
'Undoubtedly, for there is a population of about
seven thousand&mdash;principally fishermen&mdash;and the town
is fortified.'
</p>

<p>
'All right&mdash;let me get my men ashore, and we
shall march in.  The officer commanding must find us
quarters.  I long to stretch my legs on dry land again.'
</p>

<p>
Old Crank proved right; we were really wrecked
upon those dangerous rocks which lie about the two
little isles of Venetica, in the Bay of Salonica, about
ninety miles from the mouth of the Dardanelles, and
fifty from Constantinople, by the coast road.
</p>

<p>
A careful inspection of the <i>Vestal</i> proved that our
carpenter's idea of getting her safely off, under any
circumstances, was quite impracticable.  She was
firmly wedged and bulged between two masses of
rock, and was so seriously injured that even were
steam power procured sufficient to drag her into
deep water, she would instantly sink.  Thus all hope
of preserving the shattered hull of our old donkey-frigate
was abandoned; and as the sea was now calm,
and she might be some weeks of going to pieces, we
prepared to hoist up the battery guns, the ship's
carronades, the stores, &amp;c., and make other
arrangements for disembarking by the boats with all due
order and regularity.
</p>

<p>
Our men were paraded on deck, accoutred in heavy
marching order, with their knapsacks, wooden
canteens, greatcoats, and haversacks.  The luggage,
spare arm-chests, and squad-bags, were all brought
up from below, and everything in the form of stores,
clothing, and articles of value, were prepared for
landing.  Captain Crank, with Major Catanagh and
an interpreter, were pulled ashore in the pinnace,
with a well-armed crew, to make arrangements with
the Turkish authorities for our reception and
transmission to Constantinople.
</p>

<p>
With considerable interest&mdash;if not with some
anxiety&mdash;we watched them and the pinnace disappear
round a wooded promontory; and evening had almost
deepened on the land and sea before they returned
with intelligence that they had despatched tidings of
our situation to the officer commanding at Scutari,
and had made arrangements with Mir Alai Said, a
Turkish colonel, who commanded in Heraclea, to
afford us quarters in the barrack of that town.
</p>

<p>
We passed that night in the wreck.  She was firm
and motionless as the rocks on which she lay; but
the occasional surging of the sea against her shattered
sides, and the gurgling of the water, as it ebbed and
flowed in the lower hold, together with the natural
fear that some portion of her might give way in the
night, kept us all anxious and wakeful; though Jack
Belton was the life of our little party, and favoured
us with his usual ditty&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'To be sad about trifles is trifling and folly,<br />
  Since the chief end of life is to live and be jolly.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Though, like myself, he had only his pay, Jack was
the most heedless of all heedless fellows.  His father
had been ruined, or nearly so, by a plea which had
been before the Scottish Lords of Council and Session
for the last fifty years; and which, in the hands of
an able advocate and sharp-practising agent, like our
friend the late-lamented Snaggs, bade fair to go on
for another half century.
</p>

<p>
We idled away the chilly hours, muffled in our
cloaks, regimental plaids, and paletots or bernous, à
la Bedouin, over cigars, wine, and brandy-and-water,
singing songs, telling stories, and practising the
Highland feat of sheathing and unsheathing the
claymore with both hands turned outwards, and playing
other pranks, till again the bright sun of Asia shone
upon the sea of Marmora, and after tiffin of biscuit,
brandy, and junk, we paraded, to disembark upon the
old historic shore of Roumelia.
</p>

<p>
I went off in the first boat with Mac Pherson (the
captain of our Light Company), Jack Belton, Callum
Dhu, and about thirty privates.  We pulled away
clear of the wreck into blue water, and then steered
towards the shore, where three Turkish officers, on
horseback, were waiting to receive us.  After pulling
for more than a mile through a sea which shone like
burnished gold, and the transparent waves of which
enabled us to perceive, at a vast depth below, the
rank luxuriance of its dark green weeds, spreading
their broad and tremulous leaves over a bed of snow-white
sand, we reached the point indicated by Captain
Crank as our landing-place.  It was a rough and
barren part of the coast, where the rocks were piled
over each other in confusion, with a coarse bulbous
plant, like a crocus, which spread its crooked leaves
between the gaping interstices of the stones.  No
bushes or trees were there; but there were vultures,
storks, and cranes, that hovered over the ruins of an
old Roman wall, and flapped their wings upon the
prostrate columns of a Corinthian temple, that lay
half-merged among the waters of the encroaching
sea.
</p>

<p>
As our boat grounded, the three Turkish officers&mdash;each
of whom wore the scarlet <i>fez</i> (which is named
from the city of Fez), with its gold military button,
the tight blue surtout, and crooked sabre, which
make up the invariable costume of all in the service
of the Sultan&mdash;brought their horses near, and as we
sprang ashore, accorded to us the usual military
salute; and one&mdash;a lieutenant&mdash;in very tolerable
French, bade us welcome to the land of the Osmanli.
</p>

<p>
Mir Alai Said and the Mulazim (<i>i.e.</i>, lieutenant)
Ahmed were both handsome men, with keen Asiatic
features, and dark eyes that glittered with somewhat
of the cunning expression peculiar to all of Oriental
blood; but the third, of whom the reader will hear
more in future chapters, the Hadjee Hussein Ebn al
Ajuz, was a Yuze Bashi, or captain of artillery, and
wore the blue uniform, gold epaulettes, and laced belt
and trousers of the corps of Bombardiers.  He was
a punchy, shaggy-browed, solemn, stately, and
sulky-looking old Turk, with a heavy grizzled moustache;
a skin of the hue of mahogany, and an eye that
seemed to be for ever watching you, and you only.
Besides, he spoke a little absurd broken English,
which he picked up at Acre, during the war against
Mehemet Ali.
</p>

<p>
While our men were scrambling ashore from the
boats, as each in succession came in and grounded,
we asked the Mir Alai what were the news from the
seat of war?
</p>

<p>
'We have fought a brave battle on the Ingour,'
replied the colonel, rather haughtily, as it is not the
etiquette of the Turkish service for juniors to
question a senior.  'Omar Pasha, with 20,000 Osmanlis,
crossed the river in Mingrelia, in the face of a
desperate fire of cannon and musketry; and fighting, with
the water up to their armpits, stormed the position
from 16,000 Russians, whom they forced to retreat.'
</p>

<p>
'And the Czar, whom God confound, has left the
Crimea,' added the fat Captain Hussein Ebn al Ajuz;
'may the Prophet burn the Russian liars, who eat
blood and swine's-flesh, and take usury!  May he
transform their young men into apes, and their old
ones into swine, as he did those who, of old, offered
incense to idols!'
</p>

<p>
'Amaum!  Amaum!' muttered the other two, under
their thick moustaches.
</p>

<p>
Mac Pherson, who had served long in India, retained
his gravity; but Belton, on catching a twinkle of my
eye, laughed aloud at these quaint expressions of
hatred, which were uttered in a strong jargon of
Turkish and queer French.
</p>

<p>
'And Kars&mdash;does it still hold out?'
</p>

<p>
'Mashallah! have you not heard?' they exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;we have been at sea.'
</p>

<p>
'Kars is valueless as the cleft of a date-stone!'
said the Mir Alai.
</p>

<p>
'Then it has fallen!' we exclaimed together.
</p>

<p>
'It capitulated through famine to that dog and son
of a dog, Mouravieff.  The garrison of the brave
Ingleez Pasha marched out with the honours of war,
and delivered themselves up to the Russians as
prisoners; thus 8,000 true Believers are detained; but
a number of militia-men have been liberated by
Mouravieff, who found in the city one hundred and
thirty pieces of cannon.'
</p>

<p>
'And Sebastopol?'
</p>

<p>
'Still holds out manfully and desperately,' said the
Mir Alai; 'but what do I see?&mdash;women coming
ashore&mdash;and, oh, Mohammed! without the vestige of
a yashmack to cover their faces.'
</p>

<p>
'Your soldiers,' said the Yuze Bashi, 'are kilted like
Arnaouts, and all giant in stature as Og the son of
Anak.  Your Mir Alai says he has two hundred of
them&mdash;how many wives have they?'
</p>

<p>
'Four,' said I.
</p>

<p>
'Four!' reiterated the Mir Alai; 'O, Mohammed! what
do we hear?'
</p>

<p>
'Our government permitted only two women per
company in the transport.'
</p>

<p>
'Four wives for two hundred men!' exclaimed
the punchy old Yuze Bashi of the Bombardiers,
turning up his round black eyes in wonderment, and
gathering the most peculiar ideas from my words;
'one wife for fifty men!  It is enough to make every
hair in the beards of the seventy imaums stand on
end with astonishment!'
</p>

<p>
'Hush,' whispered the Mir Alai, in a tone of
rebuke; 'beware what you say, Hussein; they have
come to fight with us against the Muscovites, and
may the Prophet&mdash;he who knoweth all things&mdash;shed
a ray of light upon the darkness of their souls!'
</p>

<p>
'Amaum!' mumbled the lieutenant, who, as in
duty bound, applauded all that the Mir Alai said;
'but oh, Allah! only <i>two</i> wives per company!'

CHAPTER XXXII.
<br /><br />
THE YUZE BASHI.
</h3>

<p>
Leaving a small party under Lieutenant Logan, of
ours, to protect the landing of the baggage and stores,
accompanied by our three Turkish acquaintances, we
forded a stream, with pipes playing and bayonets
fixed, and crossing the promontory, marched towards
Heraclea, which lies at the bottom of a little bay,
and on the land side is defended by walls, though
somewhat old and rent; and in a short time we
marched in, making its streets of old dilapidated
and worm-eaten timber houses; its domed mosques,
and tall white-painted minars; its ruined palace of
Vespasian; its Greek café; its Jewish bazaar; its
whirling windmills; its stony and slippery
thoroughfares and old ruins of the Grecian days, ring to the
sharp rat-tat of the British brass drum and to the
skirl of three great Scottish war-pipes, from the
chanters and nine deep drones of which our pipers
poured the stirring 'Haughs of Cromdale,' with such
effect, that the big-breeched, long-bearded, stupid-looking
old Turks, who sat smoking on carpets and platforms
at the doors and in the street, with yataghans
and pistols in their red-shawl girdles; the lively
Greeks, in tarboosh, short jacket, and blue
inexpressibles; the sharp-visaged Jews and solemn
Armenians, all opened their round black eyes, and threw up
their hands in wonder, as we wheeled up towards the
fortress in sections of threes, with arms sloped, our
tartans waving, and black feathers flaunting in the
wind.
</p>

<p>
A fry of little Osmanli gamins, barelegged, though
wearing short wide breeches and the red fez with its
long tassel, scampered about us, gamboling, uttering
shrill cries of wonder, and styling us Janissaries,
Arnaouts, Albanians, Giaours, and anything but
Britons; and thus escorted, we reached the spacious
Coumbazadjilar-Kislaci, or barrack of the Bombardiers,
where a battalion of Turkish infantry was under
arms to receive us; and with ranks open, presented
arms in a manner which would have done no discredit
to any other European troops, their drums beating, and
the officers saluting with the edge of their Damascus
sabres outwards&mdash;as it is turned inward to none but
the Sultan himself.
</p>

<p>
The officers of this battalion had done their best to
provide us with a handsome collation&mdash;so handsome
and luxurious indeed that, after our recent hardship,
the very memory of it is enough to make one whistle;
and apart from certain peculiarities, we found them
very pleasant, quaint, and conversible fellows, though
very few of them could boast of education sufficient
to entitle them to add the envied appendage of <i>effendi</i>
to their names.  Their language, like that of the
better class of Osmanli, was a mixture of Persian and
Turkish, while that of their soldiers, like the jargon
of the peasantry and boatmen of the Bosphorus, was
Turkish alone: but in this these Orientals resemble
ourselves; for in Britain the language of the educated
people is alike distinct from the Scottish tongue and
the dialects of the old Saxon.
</p>

<p>
'Mac Innon, here is to our noble selves!' said
Catanagh, in Gaelic.  'How do you like the Roumelian
wine?'
</p>

<p>
'It seems thin and poor.'
</p>

<p>
'Dioul! but it is more pleasant for you to be
drinking it here, than be imbibing sherry-cobblers
and cocktail among the Yankees.'
</p>

<p>
'True,' said I with a sigh, as I thought of the
evicted men of Glen Ora.
</p>

<p>
At this entertainment, the sulky old Yuze Bashi,
warmed by the forbidden juice of the grape (of which
being animated by our example he partook rather
freely, notwithstanding the anathemas of him whose
sabre cleft the moon in twain&mdash;Mohammed 'the Holy
Camel Driver'), seemed to conceive a sudden favour
for me, and in his strange jargon of French and
Arabic, with a few hiccups between, gave me an
account of himself and of the Sultan's service.
</p>

<p>
He was named, it would appear, Hadjee Hussein
Ebn al Ajuz (or the son of the old woman), as his
mother had been a cast-off slave of Mehemet Ali, the
Viceroy of Egypt; and his paternal parent was
supposed to be a certain enterprising corporal of
Mamelukes, who died with a bowstring about his neck for
borrowing the silver lamps of a mosque at Suez.
Little Hussein became a soldier, and fought at the
battles of Koniah and Homs, in the war against
Mehemet Ali; and in these affairs had cut off various
heads, and stowed away innumerable Egyptian ears
in the mysterious depths of his red Oriental breeches,
all to his own great satisfaction and contentment&mdash;as
a head was worth a piastre, and a pair of ears sold
before Reschid Pasha's tent for ten paras.
</p>

<p>
At the rout of Koniah he had saved the <i>only</i> pair of
Turkish colours which escaped the furious advance
of the Egyptian infantry&mdash;viz., those of Scherif Bey's
regiment&mdash;by stuffing them into his voluminous
regimental breeches, wherein various bullets lodged
harmlessly thereafter during the retreat; for this and
other acts of devotion, he was rewarded by the
government of Rodosdchig, a little fortress a few miles
from Heraclea; and after making the pilgrimage,
partly by steamer, to Mecca; after drinking of the
Zemzem well, and of that which flows at Midian
where Moussa watered the flocks at Jethro, and
rolled from its mouth a stone which the united
strength of Jethro's seven shepherds failed to move;
after kissing the holy Kaaba, and flinging a few
stones at an imaginary devil, he returned in a
mingled state of beer and beatitude to his fortress.
There, since 1842, he had spread his carpet, reposed
in the lap of a charming odalisque, and smoked his
chibouque in contentment and peace; and there&mdash;nathless
his being a Hadjeè, and the builder of a
little gilt mosque&mdash;he drank and swore like any
enlightened Christian of the western world.
</p>

<p>
Fat, cunning as Lucifer, sensual as a sybarite, and
intensely illiberal, he was a fair specimen of the old
Turk of the worst kind; and if the curve be the line
of beauty, then the shins of Hussein, like those of
most Osmanlies, were perfection.  His ears were set
high on his head; his forehead was low and narrow;
his eyebrows nearly met, and thus betokened a cruel
and revengeful nature.  He gave me, however, a
little insight into the economy of military life in the
sultan's service.
</p>

<p>
'Our regiments,' said he, 'all consist of four
battalions, and each battalion is commanded by a cole
agassi (major), and has one standard.  A colonel or
lieutenant-colonel commands the whole, with one
great standard&mdash;the banner of the prophet&mdash;upon
whose name be glory!  Each battalion has its squad
of slaves, who carry water on the march and bear
the wounded from the field of battle.  So strict is
the etiquette maintained in our service by officers,
that they never dine with subordinates in rank;
hence the jovial messes of Frangistan excite only our
wonder; and to see a great Mir Alai, who commands
four thousand bayonets, drinking wine with a poor
little devil of an ensign, would astound the whole
Turkish army.  Even in the street a superior officer
always walks half a pace before an inferior; thus I
have seen five officers all walking along a street at
once in <i>echelon</i>, and maintaining a conversation at the
same time.  None among us wear beards under the
rank of general&mdash;with a few exceptions.  A junior
officer always rises and salutes a senior on the latter
entering a room, and cannot seat himself again without
his permission, or appear before him without his
fez, belt, and sabre.  Our Turkish privates receive
about four shillings <i>Ingleez</i> per month; but our lord
the Sultan provides for their food and clothing over
and above their pay.'
</p>

<p>
I thanked the old fellow for this information,
which did not impress me highly with the position
of an officer under his Majesty Abdul-Medjid; and
after a time Jack Belton and I, tired of the entertainment,
and of hearing lamentations for the fall of Kars,
and description of a palace of silver&mdash;solid
silver&mdash;which the Sultan was to build in London when he
visited the Queen of the Ingleez; so, carefully
loading our revolvers, and placing them in our belts, we
took our regimental swords and dirks, and set forth
for a ramble in the dusk, regardless of the warnings
of Catanagh and the Mir Alai Saïd, who told us that
strangers were never safe from assassination and
robbery after sunset.  However, we took with us Callum
Dhu, who, in addition to his bayonet, carried a heavy
cudgel cut in the wood of <i>Coilchro</i>; and a regular
adventure of some kind&mdash;no matter what&mdash;was the
very thing we required to enliven us a little, after
our long sea-voyage, and our recent bibulous <i>déjeûné</i>
with the Turkish officers.
</p>

<p>
When off duty, honest Callum was seldom a moment
from my side.  The Gael have a proverb, which
says, 'affectionate to a man is his friend, but a foster-brother
is the life-blood of his heart;' and faithful as
one of my own blood could have been, was the
gallant Mac Ian to me!
</p>

<p>
As we stumbled along the narrow and muddy
streets, we soon remarked the total absence of
everything that resembled a petticoat, for the Turkish
females in their hideous wide pantaloons and ghostly
yashmacks were unlike aught that was human, as
they flitted among the few shops which the town
contained.  The sun had long since set, and the
night was dark.  There is no twilight in Turkey,
where the sunshine and darkness succeed each other
suddenly at certain seasons.
</p>

<p>
'I miss nothing so much here as the petticoat, God
bless it!' said Belton, 'for you must allow, Allan,
that it is a very interesting and somewhat mysterious
garment.'
</p>

<p>
'Charmingly so! and the more its amplitude, the
more its mystery,' said I.
</p>

<p>
'I don't half like those abominable Turkish trousers
on the women; but it is the very devil never to
see their faces!  We will get over that difficulty
somehow&mdash;for to be sad about trifles&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Hush, for heaven's sake, don't sing here like a
wandering Arab,' said I, interrupting the invariable
song (that Jack gave us nightly with the third allowance
of wine) as we found ourselves before an illuminated Khan.

CHAPTER XXXII.
<br /><br />
THE KHAN.
</h3>

<p>
Before the façade of this edifice, a row of illuminated
lanterns of various gaudy colours hung on orange-trees,
while through its open door and arches of
trellis-work came the hum of voices, a warm glow
of light that gushed into the pitchy obscurity
without, and the perfume of roasting coffee, with the
fragrant odour of stewing kabobs.  The building was
spacious, and contained every requisite comfort as
some one says somewhere, 'but clean sheets and a
Christian bed.'
</p>

<p>
Entering, we found a number of Turks, all well
armed of course, seated on mats round a species of
raised divan; they were smoking and were attended
by long-haired Greek girls, who were tripping about
with their beautiful feet bare and stockingless,
supplying these heavy-brained but true Believers with
coffee in diminutive cups, or tobacco bruised with
apples for their long chibouques, paper for cigarettes,
and kabobs on wooden skewers, with caviar, olives,
and cheese.
</p>

<p>
As we entered, all raised their dark and glittering
eyes to scan us, by the light of a huge gilt lantern
that hung from a dome in the centre of the Khan.
</p>

<p>
'Salaam aleikum,' said we, touching our caps.
</p>

<p>
'With you be Allah,' muttered all present; and the
keeper of the Khan, a lively Greek in wide blue
breeches, a tight brown jacket, a white apron and
glittering skull cap, hurried forward to attend us.
</p>

<p>
As an excuse to remain and to observe the company,
rather than from any necessity for refreshment,
we asked for coffee and a slight supper.  In a few
minutes we had the first, black and fragrant, with
milk, hot cake, and a preserve of grapes boiled with
walnuts, all placed before us upon two little trays
in a corner of the apartment, where a charming young
Greek girl, with her black hair plaited over her
delicate white ears, arrayed the mats and cushions for
us; then cigars were brought, and seating ourselves,
we proceeded to refresh and inspect the goodly company.
</p>

<p>
Little or no notice was taken of us by these
lumbering and ponderous Orientals, for whom even the
emotion of curiosity would be too exciting.  Yet the
large and crowded hall of this Roumelian khan
presented one of the most striking scenes I have
witnessed.
</p>

<p>
Therein seemed all the races of the Turkish empire
at coffee and chibouques.
</p>

<p>
The old Effendi, grave, solemn, pretentious, and
stupid; his turban white as snow, or green, to mark
his descent from the Holy Prophet; his beard black
as night; his nose fierce and aquiline; his eyes sparkling,
and his heavy moustache curling over the amber
mouth of his long chibouque; his scarlet nether
garments and buff boots; his ample shawl, long caftan,
and gilded dagger completing the picture.  The noble
Albanian, in his red jacket embroidered with blue
cord; his ample white kilt (like ours, above the knee);
his red-bandaged hose; his yataghan, musket, and
brass-butted pistols.  The sombre Armenian, with his
long beard and flowing robes, his grave and respectful
visage surmounted by an enormous kalpec of black
felt.  The handsome and lively Greek, unabashed by
the presence of his Turkish tyrants, and all chatter,
fun, and gaiety; closely shaved and bare-legged;
with a blue turban, short trousers, and black shoes.
The hardy Islesman in his shaggy capote; the modern
Turkish artillery officer, in his tight surtout with gold
fringe epaulettes; his little fez, with its brass plate;
his red trousers strapped tightly under French glazed
boots; his gold belt and keen Damascus sabre&mdash;oriental
in face, but decidedly occidental in dress,
and almost in idea; for the corps of <i>Topchis</i> were all
organised <i>à la Franque</i> by the Sultan Selim.  There,
too, was a fierce and scowling Tartar&mdash;dropped Heaven
knows from where&mdash;but armed to the teeth, with
dagger, pistols, bow and arrows, toasting dough-balls
in the brazier.  A moolah and a dervish in their grey
felt caps that taper like an extinguisher: and lastly,
there was a disgusting Stamboul Jew, crushed in
aspect, cunning in eye, with contracted brow and
blubber lip; avaricious in soul and unyielding in
purpose.  A few black slaves, hideous in face and
scanty in attire, but very intent on <i>backsish</i>, may
complete this sketch of a picturesque group&mdash;or if aught
be wanting, let me mention the powerful form of
Callum Dhu, in his belted plaid, green kilt, and white
sporran, as he sat hobbing and nobbing with a
dervish over a dish of mutton ham; though honest
Callum knew as much of the language and ideas of the
dervish as he did about the nature and habits of 'the
Dodo and its kindred.'
</p>

<p>
The conversation generally consisted of occasional
and disjointed remarks, with long pauses between.
</p>

<p>
The war was less spoken of than the prices of
tobacco, maize, rice, silk, cotton, and wheat, and
other products of the land; but Jack and I could
glean that they were not a little proud of the
circumstance, that the little Turkish war-steamer, the
<i>Mahmoudieh</i>, and a Hadriote brig, by steering in another
direction, had escaped the storm which threw our
vessel on the reefs of Palegrossa.
</p>

<p>
'Each of these fellows is quite a bijou,' said Jack
Belton; 'I would give the world to have them all
at home and comfortably ensconced in a handsome
caravan, and to become their Barnum throughout Britain.'
</p>

<p>
'What are the news from Europe?' asked the
Turkish officer of Topchis, in French.
</p>

<p>
'Very unimportant,' replied Belton; 'in the
west, the eyes of all men are turned to the east, and
nothing is heard of, thought of, or spoken of, but this
protracted siege of Sevastopol&mdash;while diplomatists
seem to be splitting straws at Paris and Vienna.'
</p>

<p>
'Splitting straws?' pondered the literal Turk,
'Glory be to Allah!  A strong employment for
generals and viziers&mdash;have they no grooms to chop
their straw?'
</p>

<p>
A sudden commotion in the street without, and the
irregular tramp of men marching, attracted the attention
of all the loiterers in the khan; and as several
Turks left their pipes and mats, and with their hands
on their weapons, hurried to the door, Belton and I
sprang up to see what was the matter.
</p>

<p>
The gleam of arms and the blaze of torches lightened
in the dark and muddy street, as a party of six
Turkish marines, in their blue uniforms and red fez
caps, with crossed belts and fixed bayonets, escorted
a Greek prisoner towards the barrack of the Bombardiers.
After saying a few words to his guard, the
prisoner paused at the open window of the khan,
which faced the street, and begged 'a draught of
cold water in the name of God.'
</p>

<p>
The keeper was about to give it, but paused; for
the delinquent was his countryman, and the eyes
of many armed Turks were fixed with a lowering
expression on both.
</p>

<p>
During this brief pause, I scrutinized the prisoner.
</p>

<p>
He was a young man, as nearly as I could judge,
about five-and-twenty: his features were no less
remarkable for their manly beauty than singular in
their character.  His long hair, which hung in heavy
locks from under his little blue Greek cap, were
black as night; his eyes and his smart moustache
were jet; but his features were wan, sickly, and
as ghastly as those of a corpse.  His attire was the
splendidly-embroidered blue jacket, white kilt, and
bandaged hose of an Albanian officer&mdash;but all frayed,
torn, and disfigured.  His appearance was singularly
striking, and that nothing might be wanting to
complete it, and excite our sympathy, on his wrists were
two massive steel fetters, which were joined by a
heavy iron chain.
</p>

<p>
Again he pointed to his parched lips, and hoarsely
begged a cup of water.
</p>

<p>
From the hand of a Turk who stood near us I
snatched a cup of wine&mdash;that Thracian wine which
Pliny commended in the happier days of Greece&mdash;and
handed it to the poor Albanian.  A glance of deep
gratitude flashed from his dark expressive eyes, as,
thirstily and joyfully, he drained the cup and
returned it to me with a graceful bow.  With a few
words of apology, I handed it to the Turk, but that
personage drew back with a scowl on his brow, and,
with a hand on his poniard, tossed the cup away.
</p>

<p>
The Greek kissed both his fettered hands to me,
and retired: the fixed bayonets flashed again around
him, and the dark group disappeared; but his glance
of thankfulness was still before me, and it sunk deep
into my heart.
</p>

<p>
'Bono!' said an old Moolah, who was named
Moustapha, in approval of what I had done; ''twas
a good action, Frank, and thy better angel will write
it ten times down in Heaven.'
</p>

<p>
'Who is this Greek?' I inquired, of the fat old
Yuze Bashi Hussein, who at that moment entered the
khan, shouting imperiously, 'Hola, Boba!&mdash;Here
woman, coffee!'&mdash;and the speed with which his wants
were supplied, almost before he had seated his
amplitude upon a carpet, showed that our captain of
Bombardiers was not a person to be trifled with.  He
hated Greeks, but his animosity was confined only
to the males of that race.  Though he scowled at the
keeper of the khan, he leered at his wife who
attended us.  She was a pretty woman of Scio, who
wore the grotesque costume of that island&mdash;a braided
red jacket, with a short padded green skirt.  On her
head was a small cap, from which hung a veil on the
sides of her face and gracefully down her back; a
circlet of Paphian diamonds, or rock crystals, from
Baffo, glittered round her pretty neck, on which the
huge eyes of the Yuze Bashi gloated from time to
time.  But to resume&mdash;'Who is this Greek?' I
asked.
</p>

<p>
'The worst of traitors: 'grumbled Hussein.
'Every one who comes into this world is touched
by the devil, who attends at his birth <i>unseen</i>; but
Inshallah!  Shaitaun must have taken a rough hold
of our Greek!  He was an officer&mdash;a mulazim in the
regiment of Albanians who garrisoned this place
before we came here.'
</p>

<p>
'An officer!' I reiterated, in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
'And chained thus!' added Belton, in the same
tone.
</p>

<p>
'Now, by the seventh paradise, but you astonish
me!' said the Captain Hussein, opening his great
oriental eyes.  'Do you forget that the man is only
a Greek, and that the Greeks, like the Russian, are
all beasts&mdash;as Zerdusht the Prophet was, who
married his grandmother, and who will have a bridle of
fire in his jaws at the last day.'
</p>

<p>
'His crime&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Was desertion.  He was stationed at the battery
near the mouth of the harbour, and fled one night in
an open boat, taking with him four Albanian soldiers.
They rowed across the Sea of Marmora to the isle of
that name; and after lurking for a time among its
marble quarries, feeding on nuts like so many
squirrels, they sailed over to Natolia, where they were
taken in the Sangiac of Bigah, and made prisoners.
The four Albanian soldiers were shot on the instant;
but he has been sent here, on board the
<i>Mahmoudieh</i>&mdash;yonder war-steamer now at anchor in the bay&mdash;and
to-morrow, before the sun is at its height, he shall be
shot to death in the Valley of the Little Mosque.'
</p>

<p>
'After all he has endured?'
</p>

<p>
'Poor fellow!'
</p>

<p>
'Mashallah!  Human life is only a deceitful enjoyment,'
replied Hussein, who was an inveterate quoter
of the Koran; 'but may I never see Paradise if his
story is not a strange one; I shall tell it to you&mdash;'tis
a tale, like any other, and I heard it all, being one
of the court-martial at Bigah which sentenced him
to die.'
</p>

<p>
After draining his little coffee-cup, refilling the
capacious bowl of his pipe, and taking a few prodigious
whiffs, the Yuze Bashi related the following
story, which&mdash;with the reader's permission&mdash;I will
rehearse in my own words; and while he spoke, the
noble figure, stately presence, pale beauty, and
splendid eyes of the manly Albanian Greek, seemed
ever and painfully to be before me.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIV.
<br /><br />
STORY OF THE GREEK LIEUTENANT.
</h3>

<p>
Sixteen years ago, when the Allied Powers united to
assist the Sultan in his conflict with old Mehemet
Ali, then pasha of Egypt, and nominally his vassal,
the insurgent garrison of Acre was successfully
bombarded, as all the world knows, by the British
fleet, under the flag of Commodore Sir Charles Napier,
who on that occasion distinguished himself with his
usual skill, bravery, and intrepidity.  The fortress
was taken in a few hours; but the destruction and
slaughter were fearfully augmented by the explosion
of a magazine of powder and live bombs, by which
the venerable ramparts of St. John were reduced to
a pile of blackened ruins.  The roar of the exploding
powder was appalling; from the low headland of Acre
there ascended into the pure blue Syrian sky a
mighty column of smoke and dust.  The lonely
Kishon was startled in its stony bed; every mosque,
khan, and bazaar in the city rocked to its foundation,
while the whole waters of the bay were agitated by
the concussion and rolled in foamy ripples on the
rocks of Cape Carmel.
</p>

<p>
In that explosion one thousand five hundred brave
soldiers who had escaped the dangers and withstood
the horrors of the bombardment were in a moment
swept into eternity.
</p>

<p>
Of the many who perished, none was more universally
regretted by the Egyptian garrison, and even
by the British commander, than Demetrius Vidimo,
a Greek captain, who served the Pasha, in mere
hatred of the Sultan and of the Turks, who were the
tyrants of his people&mdash;a hatred in which he was
sustained by his wife, who was the daughter of a Sciote
patriot of high rank.  Demetrius had participated in
all the horrors of the Greek struggle for independence,
when the men of Missolonghi, after a year's
siege of hardship unparalleled, and after defying all the
united power of Turkey and of Egypt&mdash;after having
a hundred thousand bombs and balls shot among
them, buried themselves in the ruins of the city.  He
had seen the pyramid of Grecian skulls that rose near
the grave of Bozzaris; he had seen the horrors of the
massacre of Scio, when fifty thousand frantic Turks
drenched the loveliest of the Ægean Isles in blood,
slaying sixty thousand Sciotes in its streets, and
carrying thirty thousand into hopeless slavery.  He had
seen the manly boys and beautiful girls of Greece
sold at a dollar a-head in the streets of Smyrna.  He
had seen their mothers ripped open by the Turkish
sabre and the handjiar, and the children torn reeking
from the womb and dashed against the walls of
Athens, for the wildest beasts of Africa or India were
mild as tender lambs when compared to the merciless,
brutal, and unglutted soldiery of Mahmoud the Second.
He had seen the slave-market of Stamboul crowded
with Grecian captives&mdash;brave men struggling and
raving in their futile vengeance against the Osmanlies;
and women&mdash;the pale virgin and the weeping
mother&mdash;shrinking in the agonies of separation from all they
loved, and in horror of their lewd and sensual
purchasers, who bought them from the troops for the
value of twelve cartridges, a pipe-stick, or a piastre,
and dragged them away to slavery, and worse than
slavery, in their harems, dens, and anderuns at
Stamboul.
</p>

<p>
He had seen all these things, and the soul of
Demetrius was fired by a thirst for undying vengeance
upon the oppressors of his people.
</p>

<p>
He was an Albanian, and chief of one of the eight
tribes of the Scutari mountains.  Hardy, brave,
reckless to a fault, and fired alike by enthusiasm and
revenge, he had distinguished himself on a thousand
occasions against the Turks; and at the previous
storming of Acre&mdash;eight years before&mdash;when Ibrahim
Pasha, at the head of forty thousand Egyptians and
Arabs, besieged it for six months, the Grecian Captain
Vidimo in every assault was conspicuous, both by his
bravery and his picturesque Albanian costume; for
wherever death was to be found or danger sought
and glory won, there towered the figure of Vidimo, in
his skull-cap, with his long hair flowing under it;
his fleecy capote flung loosely over his shoulder; his
white kilt and scarlet buskins, leading on the van of
battle, and handling in rapid succession the long
musket, the crooked sabre, deadly yataghan and
pistols, which are the native weapons of the Albanian
mountaineer.
</p>

<p>
But he perished in the explosion at Acre, and so
there was an end of him, greatly to the regret of his
comrades, and very much to the grief of the Yuze
Bashi Hussein, who had set his whole heart upon
taking the valiant Greek dead or alive, and laying
his head at the feet of Mahmoud the Second, to claim
the promised reward.
</p>

<p>
The Turks were furious! not even his body was to
be found, though the Sultan had offered a princely
sum for it; and amid all the heads hewn off after the
bombardment, there was not one found that would
pass muster as having belonged to Vidimo, whose
face was well known by a peculiar sabre cut which
he received at the defence of Missolonghi in 1826.
</p>

<p>
After the capture, Ali Pasha, and Hussein Ebn al
Ajuz, with other officers of the corps of Bombardiers,
enjoyed to their hearts' content the pleasure of slicing
off the head of the dark Egyptians, or stuffing
their pockets with tawny ears, and with something
better still the various good things to be picked up
in the bazaars, the great khan, the Franciscan
monastery, the Greek church, the Armenian synagogue,
and other places where the unbelieving dogs of Jews
and Christians presumed to worship in any other
fashion than that proscribed by the holy camel-driver.
</p>

<p>
During his minute researches in a certain flat-roofed
mansion near the Castle of Iron, the enterprising
Hussein and several of his soldiers discovered
a female, of great beauty, with two children, a boy
and a girl, concealed in an alcove; and while the
poor little ones with terror in their wild black eyes,
screamed and clung to the skirt of their pale mother,
the soldiers of Hussein, with brandished weapons,
and fierce Turkish imprecations, dragged them forth.
The woman was too handsome to be sacrificed: so
Hussein, who had a special eye to female loveliness,
saved her at once, by sabring one of his Majesty's
soldiers and pistolling another, to cool the ardour of
the rest; but now, a dozen or more of Turkish
officers, flushed alike by blood, which is enjoined by
the Koran, and by wine, which is forbidden by it,
crowded into the apartment.
</p>

<p>
The beauty of the captive inflamed them all, and a
furious contention ensued, as to who should possess
her.
</p>

<p>
She offered a thousand Xeriffs as the ransom of her
honour and her children's lives; but the princely
guerdon was received and rent from her, with shouts
of derision.
</p>

<p>
Then Ali Pasha asserting his senior rank, seized
her rudely.
</p>

<p>
'Hold!' she exclaimed, in a piercing voice and
with a nobility of gesture which made even <i>him</i>
draw back; 'I am a Christian woman&mdash;the daughter
of a Sciote noble, and the widow of him who died
to-day, Demetrius Vidimo, and these are his children,
Constantine and Iola&mdash;we shall die together!' and
with these words, she took from her bosom a coral
cross and tied it round the neck of her little boy,
believing him to be in more imminent danger than her
daughter.
</p>

<p>
Again the Turks uttered a fierce derisive shout;
but stood irresolute, when confronted by this Greek
woman, whose aspect awed them.
</p>

<p>
She was clad in black, as being indicative of her
fallen fortune; a snow-white kerchief covered her
head, and gave a Madonna-like expression to her
deep, black, thoughtful eyes, and soft but marble
features; for she possessed, in its greatest purity, all
the classic beauty of the ancient Greek women&mdash;a
clear complexion, and long thick tresses, dark as the
northern night.  She was lovely, feminine, and sad
in her expression, for in her time she had seen those
things which were more than enough to banish smiles
for ever from her face; yet, unblanched by past
sorrow or by present danger, her lips were&mdash;strange
to say&mdash;alluringly rosy, as her teeth were dazzingly
white.
</p>

<p>
Her form was tall and full, and maternity had given
a charming roundness to the slenderness of figure
which usually falls to the lot of Greek women.
</p>

<p>
Inflamed by the desire of possessing a captive so
fair, every Turk stood by with pistol and sabre in
hand, resolved to die rather than yield her to another.
The stern altercation was fierce and noisy; and there
amid that terrible group, pale, and, like Niobe, all in
tears, with her younglings clinging to her skirts, the
widowed mother stood, trembling in her soul, for she
knew that such mercy as tigers accord would be the
mercy given to her.
</p>

<p>
'Since all cannot possess&mdash;by everything that is
holy! let us all destroy her!' cried Hussein, levelling
a pistol.
</p>

<p>
'Allah&mdash;Allah!  Amaum!  Amaum!' cried Ali
Pasha, and the crowd of Turks.  A confused discharge
of pistols took place, and pierced by more than
twenty balls, the mother fell dead with her blood
spouting over her children, and so ended the dispute;
for the sun set at that moment, and they all hastened
out, to kneel and say the <i>Salât al Moghreb</i>, or evening
prayer, so Hussein was left in possession alike of the
dead body, of the children, and the premises.
</p>

<p>
After rifling the corpse of its rings and jewels, he
took away the orphans to make slaves of them.
</p>

<p>
Perceiving that the girl, Iola, then in her sixth
year, promised to be beautiful, he kept her; the boy,
Constantine, he gave to Ali Pasha, colonel of the
Bombardiers, who made a soldier of him, and in time
he became a lieutenant of Albanians in the service of
the Sultan&mdash;but he never forgot the cause for which
his father fought&mdash;vengeance for Greece, or the death
which his mother died; and thus, seeking the first
opportunity of leaving a service so hateful as that of
Abdul Medjid, he had deserted from Heraclea; but
was retaken, tried and sent back by the <i>Mahmoudieh</i>
steam-ship, and on the morrow was to die.  The
cry of the exterminating angel would be heard, and
an Unbeliever would perish like a withered bud, or
like a palm-tree struck by lightning.
</p>

<p>
I cannot express the aversion we felt for the old
Yuze Bashi, who with singular coolness related
the part he had borne in this barbarous episode of
the Egyptian revolt; and which, with occasional
whiffs of his chibouque, he related as quietly as
one might do the account of a little shooting
excursion, or the result of a pic-nic party, and nothing
more.
</p>

<p>
'And Iola&mdash;the daughter,' I asked; 'what became
of her?'
</p>

<p>
'That I cannot tell you,' said he; 'she is never
named to me now.'
</p>

<p>
'Does she know of the fate that hangs over her
brother?'
</p>

<p>
'No!'
</p>

<p>
'She is dead, then?'
</p>

<p>
'To him&mdash;and to the world, at least.'
</p>

<p>
'Which means that she is&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Married&mdash;exactly.'
</p>

<p>
'So inquiries might only be unpleasant, if not
dangerous?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'But when her brother is to die?'&mdash;began Belton.
</p>

<p>
'She shall never know of it,' replied Hussein.
'What useful end would be served by conveying
the information to her.  She would weep, and the
tears of women are a great annoyance now, since we
cannot apply the bastinado without permission from
a Kadi or Moolah.  Bah! this Constantine Vidimo is
only a Greek, and one ball will kill him: in a
moment all will be over.'
</p>

<p>
'Only a Greek!' reiterated Belton, who had been
poring over the <i>Corsair</i> on our outward voyage; 'are
not the Greeks human beings?'
</p>

<p>
'Scarcely&mdash;know you not, O Frank! that the Lord
of the world hath sealed up their hearts and their
hearing, and veiled their sight by a dimness.'
</p>

<p>
Tired of the Yuze Bashi and his barbarous ideas,
we rose to bid him farewell and leave the khan; but
he, having a wholesome terror of Ghoules, Guebres,
and Genii in the dark, resolved on accompanying us
to our quarters; for he too had rooms in the
Coumbazadjilar-Kislaci.  Thus we found the impossibility
of shaking him off, and as we stumbled on, arm-in-arm
with this epauletted assassin, followed step for
step by Callum Dhu, through the dark, muddy, and
unpaved streets of Heraclea, he told us various other
pretty little episodes of himself and Ali Pasha.
</p>

<p>
The name of the latter must be familiar to the
reader, as being the Turkish General of Brigade
whose infamous abduction and murder of a young
and beautiful Greek girl in the suburbs of Varna
lately roused the indignation of the French
commandant, by whose humane exertions, for the FIRST
time in Oriental history, an Osmanli was tried for the
murder of a Christian; and consequently Ali Pasha,
the Brigadier; Lieutenant Mohammed Aga, his
aide-de-camp; Hussein Aga, his steward; and Corporal
Moustapha, appeared before a tribunal, which, of
course, acquitted them; for every hair in the beard
of a true Believer is worth all the benighted souls in
Christendom.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXV.
<br /><br />
THE EXECUTION.
</h3>

<p>
With the melancholy story of Constantine Vidimo in
my mind, the reader may imagine with what emotion
I heard the Turkish drums beating in the barrack-yard
for the punishment parade next morning,
and our three pipers playing the <i>gathering</i>, for our
little detachment, as a portion of the Allied troops,
had to attend the painful scene.
</p>

<p>
Callum Dhu, now a smart and active soldier, appeared
punctually to accoutre me with my pipe-clayed
belt, sword, &amp;c., and while the sun was yet below the
sea, I issued into the shady square of the
Coumbazadjilar-Kislaci, where our sergeants were calling the
roll, and where the battalion of the Mir Alai Saïd,
with short blue tunics, scarlet trousers, and
tarbooshes, were falling in by companies, while a few
<i>topchis</i>, or gunners, were being slowly and laboriously
paraded and mustered by the ponderous Yuze Bashi
Hussein.
</p>

<p>
The parade was soon formed, and the two commanding
officers, Mir Alai Saïd and Major Catanagh,
mutually complimented each other on the appearance
of their men; and, in truth, this Turkish battalion,
in efficiency, order, and discipline, would have done
no discredit to any army in Europe.  Their faces
were dark and fierce, keen and Asiatic; their words
of command, like their names, sounded wild and
barbaric, as <i>ours</i> must have been to them; but, with a
few exceptions, every manoeuvre and tactic were
modelled after our own.
</p>

<p>
While expressing astonishment and even merriment
at the large plumed bonnets, hairy sporrans,
and bare knees of our men, the Mir Alai was
delighted by their athletic figures.  The jewelled
dirks, claw-pistols, and basket-hilted claymores of
the officers excited his interest, and he vowed by
the beard of the Prophet that he had never before
seen weapons of such a fashion or of finer workmanship.
</p>

<p>
'Stout fellows all,' said he, in strange English, as
he patted the shoulder of Callum, who was a flank
file; 'their hands will soon be hardened by carrying
the brass-butted musket.'
</p>

<p>
'If they do not become food for powder and the
Russian worms, colonel,' replied Catanagh.
</p>

<p>
The sun rose above the sea of Marmora, and at
that instant the shrill wild voice of the muezzin from
the lofty minaret of an adjacent mosque pierced the
silence and purity of the morning with the summons
to early prayer.
</p>

<p>
Then the Turkish battalion, which had been standing
at ease, with ordered arms, and formed in open
columns of companies at quarter distance, bent their
heads in prayer, and many produced their beads of
cedar-wood, and commenced their orisons with a
fervour that impressed us with no small respect for
these poor Moslem soldiers; but after a time the
sharp drum beat a roll, the whole battalion started
to 'attention'&mdash;the bayonets were fixed&mdash;the arms
'shouldered,' and as the <i>right</i> was assigned to us, the
whole presented arms, with drums beating, and their
single colour flying, as we marched out to the place
of execution, with our pipes playing.  The Osmanlies
followed, with their brass band, cymbals, bells,
tambourines, and triangles, performing something
that was meant for a march; but its measure was
more wild and barbaric than pleasing.
</p>

<p>
The morning was brilliant; on our left the sea of
Marmora shone like an ocean of glass, and the rakish
little Greek caiques were shooting out upon its
bosom from the shady creeks and sunny inlets, where
they had been anchored overnight.
</p>

<p>
Marching out by an ancient gate, which was encrusted
by carving and old inscriptions, and covered
by ivy and acanthus-leaves, we traversed a causeway
coeval perhaps with the days of Zeuxis and the palace
of Vespasian, and reached a little hollow, which was
surrounded by groves of the olive, the emblem of
peace&mdash;the tree which Minerva gave to Greece, and
which, as the poets say, was grasped by Latona in
her maternal throes.
</p>

<p>
It was a lonely place, and no sound was heard there
but the coo of the wild pigeon or the flapping of a
stork's wing, as he sat on a prostrate column, the
rich Corinthian capital of which was almost buried
among luxuriant creepers, weeds, and wild flowers.
In this valley stood a little gilded mosque, having a
shining dome, and two taper minarets, like gigantic
candlesticks, the tops of which, to complete the
resemblance, seemed to be lighted; but this was merely
the sun's rays tipping with fire their bulbous-shaped
roofs of polished brass.  Around towered a group of
solemn cypresses, which cast their shadows on the
marble slabs, the green mounds, the turbaned headstones,
and gilded sarcophagi that marked where many
a true Believer lay.
</p>

<p>
A little apart from these, a new grave freshly dug
was yawning darkly among the green grass and
dewy morning flowers.
</p>

<p>
Beside it knelt the Greek officer, and near him
were twelve Turkish soldiers, with their bayonets
fixed.
</p>

<p>
As we halted in the valley, and formed three sides
of a hollow square, a bell jangled in the mosque,
and the Hafiz Moustapha, and moolah or priest,
wearing long robes and a turban of green cloth, came
slowly forth, bearing the Koran in his hand; and
now a chill fell on all our hearts, for to us this scene
and all these preparations were solemn, strange, and
new.
</p>

<p>
I gazed with deep interest at the poor young
Greek, who was still upon his knees, and who seemed
to have given up all his soul to God in prayer and
outpouring of the heart&mdash;and as I surveyed his face,
so pure and cold, so noble and severe in its classic
beauty, all the episodes of his dark and terrible story
came before me; and at that time I felt an
abhorrence of all Osmanli in general, and our
bulbous-shaped Yuze Bashi in particular.  Of all who were
present his visage expressed the least concern, for to
him the shooting of a Greek was infinitely of less
moment than the shooting of a crow.
</p>

<p>
The poor Albanian!
</p>

<p>
On rising from his orisons, he looked calmly about
him; but nowhere save in our own ranks did he
meet with eyes of sympathy.  Perhaps we had
somewhat of a fellow-feeling for a bare-kneed soldier
whose garb so nearly resembled our own, for the
white camise of the mountaineer of <i>Albania</i> and the
tartan kilt of the mountaineer of <i>Albany</i> are as nearly
identical as the old tradition of that mutual descent
from one stock would make us, a tradition strangely
corroborated by the old classic names of Hector,
Æneas, Helen, and Constantine being still preserved
among the Highland clans.  But enough of this
legendary fustian.
</p>

<p>
Constantine Vidimo was drawing nearer our ranks,
when again the bell rang in the mosque; and shrinking
back to the side of the newly-dug grave, he
folded his arms and gazed fiercely at the Turks.
</p>

<p>
The spiritual consolation of a Greek priest of his
own religion was denied him in this terrible hour, the
bitterness of which the old wretch named Moolah
Moustapha left nothing unsaid to enhance, for he was
an ancient Mohammedan, who could remember the
'good old times' when the true Believer had the
power of forcing every Christian dog, however high
in rank, to sweep the muddy streets of Stamboul
before him at his caprice and whim.
</p>

<p>
With his hands crossed on the Koran, which he
pressed to his breast; with his long white beard
spreading over it, and his long green robe falling in
heavy folds from his shoulders to the grass, he faced
the Turkish troops, and strung together a number
of disjointed quotations from the Koran, which, as
Belton whispered, were mere incentives to bloodshed
and bigotry.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, true Believers! wage war against such of
the Infidels as are near you&mdash;let them find no security
in you, and know that God is only with those who
fear him.  Should the divine vengeance fall upon
you either by day or by night, believe that the wicked
have hastened it upon you.  The Believer dieth
happy, a possessor of Eden, through which flows
rivers of wine and sherbet; he is adorned with bracelets
of fine gold, and he is clothed in silken garments
of fine green cloth; glory surrounds him; he sleeps
in a couch of pearl, with his head pillowed on the
soft bosom of a black-eyed girl, and his reward is
to dwell for ever in the abode of delight; but <i>thou</i>, oh
Greek! after appearing at the last day, chained to
the geni who seduced thee, shall broil for ever in the
dark caves of everlasting fire&mdash;a poor bubble, swept
down the burning torrents of the river of Woe!'
</p>

<p>
To all this I could perceive that the Turkish
soldiers listened with considerable impatience; for there
is, I believe, a natural antipathy springing up
between the military and the religious of the Ottoman
empire.  Being rough, and not ungenerous, the
Turkish soldier despises the moolahs, muftis, imaums,
dervishes, calanders, and fakirs, for their cunning,
avarice, hypocrisy, and secret immorality; while
they, in turn, rail at and preach against the soldiers
for wearing tight pantaloons, relinquishing the
turban for the fez, learning to drink raki, and generally
for following a little too closely the customs of Europe.
</p>

<p>
'Have a righteous fear of Mohammed, oh,
Believers!' resumed the Hafiz Moustapha, 'and you
will die in the faith, and find the Koran the only
sure cord to heaven; but,' he added, turning his face
to us, for this moolah had been a soldier&mdash;<i>a corporal
of Grenadiers</i>&mdash;in his youth, as the reader shall learn
more at length; 'but may the holy Prophet, who
sees all that night veils and day enlightens&mdash;who
knoweth and heareth all things, bless these infidels,
who have come to fight for the land of Islam!'
</p>

<p>
'Amaum! amaum!' muttered the Mir Alai Saïd,
as he waved his sabre impatiently to the mulazim
commanding the party of twelve soldiers, whose
muskets were to despatch the prisoner, and a chaoush
(sergeant) who stood on their flank, armed with a
pistol, carefully examining its lock and priming.
</p>

<p>
An onboshi (corporal) approached with a handkerchief
to bind up the eyes of the Greek lieutenant;
but scorning alike to kneel or be blindfolded, he stood
boldly confronting the firing party at the distance of
thirty yards, fearlessly and firm.  He drew a cross
from his breast&mdash;the coral cross of Hussein's savage
story&mdash;the cross his mother had tied around his neck
at Acre, and after kissing it, he held it up in our
view, and said in somewhat broken English&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'It is the emblem of your faith&mdash;the religion in
which I die.  Let not these Turkish swine defile it
when I am gone.  Who among you Christian men
will take it from my hand, and keep it as the last
gift of a wretch who never knew what it was to
be happy?'
</p>

<p>
'I will!' exclaimed I, starting forward.
</p>

<p>
He grasped my hand, and his beautiful dark eyes
flashed with dusky fire, as he waved his right arm
with pride, and exclaimed&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Now, dogs&mdash;I am ready for you!'
</p>

<p>
His aspect and bearing were splendid.
</p>

<p>
Stern and unyielding as the Prometheus of Æschylus,
braving the fury of his tyrants, and scorning to
sue for mercy or stoop his haughty head, the noble
Greek stood before the levelled muskets that were
to destroy him.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Nishan ale!</i>'  (ready&mdash;present) cried the Turkish
commander of the platoon.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Atesh!</i>' (fire)
</p>

<p>
Flame flashed from the twelve iron tubes; twelve
bullets whistled shrilly past us, and the reports rang
like thunder in the narrow valley, scaring the stork
from the ruined column, and the wild pigeons from
the olive-grove.  The smoke curled upward in the
pure atmosphere, and the poor Greek officer lay prone
on the grass, breathing heavily, with blood pouring
in streams from his throat and bosom.  Three balls
had pierced him, yet he was not dead.
</p>

<p>
Now something like a groan ran along our ranks,
for at that moment the chaoush with the pistol
approached the dying man, placed the muzzle to his
ear, and coolly and deliberately blew out his brains!
</p>

<p>
So ended this scene of blood.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * *
</p>

<p>
Our bagpipes yelled again, and the Turkish drums
and flutes rang merrily in that valley of olives, as we
wheeled from hollow square into open column, and
breaking into sections, marched back to the barracks;
but my heart felt sick and sore, and oblivious of the
martial display, I thought only of the coral cross
which I had taken from the dead man's hand, and of
the barbarous mode in which I had seen his mutilated
and coffinless remains thrust into the grave, and
hastily earthed up, by the water-carriers, or Nubian
slaves, of the Mir Alai Saïd's regiment.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVI.
<br /><br />
IN 'ORDERS,' FOR DUTY.
</h3>

<p>
After this event, for some days I avoided the Yuze
Bashi Hussein, for whom I had conceived a horror
in consequence of the tragic story of Constantine
Vidimo, whose fate made a deep impression on the
whole of our little mess, but on none more than
myself&mdash;for I had, as related, addressed him twice,
and it was to me that his relaxing hand had slowly
yielded up the coral cross, which I resolved to
preserve as a souvenir of our service in the East.  We
ceased to invite the Yuze Bashi to mess, where his
bulbous figure, preposterous and goat-like beard,
diminutive scarlet fez, frogged surtout, long crooked
sabre, and comically ferocious visage, were an endless
source of amusement, wit, and caricature; but judge
of my annoyance when I found that, in consequence
of this modern Bashaw having conceived a vehement
fancy or friendship for me, I was to be separated from
the jovial society of my brother-officers, and to be
detached&mdash;on his especial application&mdash;with one
sergeant, one piper, and thirty rank and file, to the
castle of Rodosdchig, his military government or
commandery, which lay about thirty miles distant.
</p>

<p>
'For what purpose is this detachment detailed?'
I asked rather angrily at mess, on the day I read the
announcement in orders, as being the will and
pleasure of our Brevet-Major commanding.
</p>

<p>
'To strengthen the stout captain's little garrison
of Topchis.'
</p>

<p>
'But why?'
</p>

<p>
'They are in danger of an attack from certain
armed and insurrectionary Greeks, whom the secret
agency of some Russian priests are omitting no means
of inflaming and exciting to discontent against the
authority of the Sultan and his Pashas.'
</p>

<p>
'Why are Turks not sent&mdash;the Mir Alai has eight
hundred of them here in garrison?'
</p>

<p>
'He does us the honour to believe that red-coats
will more completely awe the malcontent Greeks.'
</p>

<p>
'In this service I may get a slash from a yataghan,
or a ball from a brass-barrelled pistol sans credit and
honour.'
</p>

<p>
'Not at all,' said Belton; 'either will be quite as
honourable as a shot from the Rifle Pits, or a splinter
from a Whistling Dick out of the Redan.'
</p>

<p>
'Which, by-the-by, none of us are likely to see,'
grumbled Catanagh, draining a long glass of Kirklissa
wine, with an angry sigh.
</p>

<p>
By this time our Major had communicated with the
British military authorities at Constantinople, detailing
the loss of the <i>Vestal</i>, and that he had obtained
quarters for his men in the Bombardiers' Barracks at
Heraclea, or <i>Erekli</i>, as the Turks name it; and, by a
messenger, he was instructed to remain in his present
cantonment until further orders, as there was every
prospect now of hostilities ceasing, and our presence
would not be required with Sir Colin Campbell and
the Highland Brigade.
</p>

<p>
At this time, January 3rd, 1856, we had fifty-eight
thousand British soldiers in the Crimea; a Council of
War, composed of British and French general officers,
had assembled in Paris, and Russia had accepted the
Austrian propositions as a basis for the negotiation of
a peace.  The despatch to the Major concluded by
stating, that the French had blown up Fort
St. Nicolas at Sebastopol, where our miners were busy
destroying the magnificent docks.  With this long
document going the round of the mess-table, we gulped
down our disappointment and the Roumelian wine
together, on the evening before I marched with this
devil of a Yuze Bashi to his castle of Rodosdchig; and
our enthusiastic hopes of a protracted war&mdash;a war that
from the mouth of the Danube would roll like a flame
over Hungary, Poland, and Italy&mdash;our hopes of rapid
promotion, of French medals and crosses of the Legion
of Honour, dwindled down into tame and vapid surmises
as to the disbanding of second battalions, and
the parsimonious reduction of additional captains,
lieutenants, and ensigns.
</p>

<p>
'So we shall be here till further orders,' observed
the Major, in conclusion.
</p>

<p>
'Abominable ill luck!' said Jack Belton.
</p>

<p>
'Instead of being at Sebastopol, in at the death.
and the glory of the affair,' chimed the captain of
our Light Bobs, 'we shall be learning to smoke
opium and sit crosslegged, to relish pillau, eat hash,
and pepperpot with our fingers.'
</p>

<p>
'And to rub up our <i>Alpha</i>, <i>Beta</i>, <i>Gamma</i>, <i>Delta</i>, and
so forth, to make love to the charming Haidees of
Roumelia&mdash;but, waiter, see who knocks at the door!'
added the Major, as a rat-tat rang on the painted door
of the long room which was fitted up for our temporary
mess, and the walls of which were painted in
arabesques with pious quotations from the Koran.
</p>

<p>
The Highlander in his kilt, who acted as one of
our mess-waiters, opened the door and ushered in our
acquaintance, the fat Yuze Bashi, who, having a
lively recollection of the bright, amber-coloured
sherry, and full-bodied old port, which we had saved
from the bulged hull of Her Majesty's steam-transport
<i>Vestal</i>, visited us as often as propriety would
allow; for he was a cunning old dog, who willingly
gave up his chance of the slender houris in Heaven
for a cup of good wine and the plump and substantial
houris of earth.
</p>

<p>
Carrying his pipe and, of course, his paunch before
him, he entered with a prodigious salaam and bowed
to us all; then he ogled the decanter, and sat down
near Catanagh, who was too polite and too much of
a soldier not to accord him a welcome.
</p>

<p>
We spoke of European politics, of which the
obtuse brain of the Yuze Bashi, Hadjee Hussein Ebn al
Ojuz, knew as much as he did about electricity, the
longitude, the 'philosoplry of the infinite,' a good
pun, or anything else, which is incomprehensible to
an Oriental mind.
</p>

<p>
Belton spoke of the Greek girls, and then the old
fellow became lively, and looked roguishly out at the
corners of his sly black eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Inshallah!' said he; 'I do love pretty girls
with all the zeal of a true Believer.  Mohammed! yes&mdash;I
have played some strange pranks in my time
among the fair-haired Tcherkesses, and the black-eyed
Cockonas of Bucharest&mdash;the City of Delights&mdash;as
its name imports.  Yes, and there are some pretty
ones in Egypt too, who have good reason to remember
the Hadjee Hussein.  But my heart has long been
fixed upon obtaining a Russian.  They are large, those
Muscovites, and plump and fair-skinned, round and
white as eggs; and, please God, I shall perhaps
have a couple of them yet.'
</p>

<p>
'Scarcely,' said Belton, 'for we are on the eve
of a peace; so, Captain, your chances are small.'
</p>

<p>
His eyes flashed fire at the idea of a peace.
</p>

<p>
'Good can never come of it!' said he; 'we shall
have all these battles to fight over again; all these
fortresses to take and to defend; and the Muscovite
swine may yet wallow upon the shores of the Golden
Horn, if Britain and France are false to us, and we
are false to ourselves!  Yet Heaven, they say, was
with us in this war.'
</p>

<p>
'They&mdash;who?'
</p>

<p>
'Mashallah! by "they," one means that mysterious
personage on whom one fathers everything that lacks
a better authority.'
</p>

<p>
'Bono!' said the major; 'well, captain&mdash;they say&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'That at Silistria ten thousand angels, in green
dresses, were visible to all the Faithful, fighting
against the God-abandoned Russians.  The Hafiz
Moustapha counted their ten green banners with a
thousand under each.  Even the English newspapers
repeated that.'
</p>

<p>
'I remember to have read it,' said I.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' resumed Hussein, gathering confidence on
my corroboration; 'ten thousand, like those who
fought for Islamism, in the war of the Ditch, and at
the battle of Bedr, against the Koreish; but instead
of iron maces, which shot forth fire at every stroke,
our Silistrian angels appeared as well-appointed
infantry.'
</p>

<p>
'By the breeches of the Prophet!' muttered the
Major, in an under tone; 'only think of ten thousand
well-appointed angels, in heavy marching order&mdash;all
with sixty rounds of ball-cartridge at their blessed
backs!'
</p>

<p>
'But if it pleases our lord the Sultan, who is God's
shadow upon earth, to make peace with these grovelling
Russian curs&mdash;if he thinks that hell is sufficiently
full of them&mdash;why should I, who am unworthy
to kiss his slippers, dare to advise?'
</p>

<p>
'Of course&mdash;so fill your glass, Captain Hussein,
and pass the bottles.'
</p>

<p>
'Abdul Medjid,' continued our fat guest, who began

the Black and White Seas; Master of Europe, Asia,

<p>
'Is devilishly in want of the "ready," I believe,'
said Belton, rather abruptly, closing a sentence the
end of which Hussein had lost.
</p>

<p>
After making various ineffectual efforts to resume
where he hud left off so suddenly, and to regain the
thread of his subject, which Jack's abrupt interruption
had somewhat entangled, Hussein dropped his
bearded chin upon his breast, and after a snort or
two, let his chibouque fall, as he dropped into a
deep sleep, overcome by the wine, of which he had
partaken too freely, and the strength of which was
too potent for him.

'Now,' said Catanagh, 'here is a good specimen of
the modern Turk, who has retained all the vices, and
none of the virtues, of his ancestors.  Selfish, sensual,
ignorant, and brutal, he is a Mohammedan only in
those things which minister to his luxury.  But the
old world is changing fast, and here the new has not
much to recommend it.  Ancient things are passing
away, and in the slaves who crouch beneath the
Turkish yoke we look in vain for the sons of those
who fought at Marathon, and who died at Thermopylæ.
Green be the grass and bright the flowers that
there grow, say I!  Omnibuses have rattled through
the gate of the Ilissus; a matter-of-fact Scotsman
has ploughed up the plains of Marathon, and gas-lamps
have shed their light upon the Acropolis.  The
'Maid of Athens' (as Stephen tells us in his book)
has become plain Mrs. George Black, the wife of
King Otho's Scotch superintendent of police, and the
buxom mother of various little Blacks&mdash;so much for
romance and for the land of Homer in the age of steam!
Turks are practising the polka and, <i>deux-temps!</i> coals
have been found in Mount Calvary, and Albert Smith
has stuck 'Punch's' posters on the Pyramid; the
Highland bagpipe, that fifty years ago rang in the
streets of Bagdad and Grand Cairo, has now sent up
its yell at the Golden Horn, and the mosque of
St. Sophia has echoed to the rattle of the <i>British
Grenadiers</i>.  We have come to the end of all things, and
may light our pipes with Æschyrus and Herodotus.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVII.
<br /><br />
I MARCH TO RODOSDCHIG.
</h3>

<p>
With a sergeant and thirty rank and file&mdash;one of
whom was Callum Dhu, and with a piper playing at
their head, I marched out of Heraclea, and by an old
paved path of the Sultan Solyman, took the coast
road to Rodosdchig.  My men were in heavy marching
order; their feather-bonnets cased in oilskins; their
great-coats rolled; their wooden canteens, haversacks,
and white gaiters on.  We were accompanied by the
portly Yuze Bashi; but as the day proved to be
Friday, which is set apart by the Mohammedans for
prayer and worship, he made it an excuse for being
lazy, and instead of riding beside me on horseback,
which, as a soldier, he ought to have done, he marched
like a prince of Bourbon, <i>i.e.</i>, travelled in his snug
araba or Turkish carriage, where he sat, trussed up
among soft cushions, and given up to dozing over his
pipe and the Prophet.
</p>

<p>
Jack Belton accompanied me for three or four miles
westward of the town, as far as an old Roman bridge,
which crosses a river with a name that no jaws save
those of a Believer were ever meant to compass;
and there bidding me warmly adieu, he galloped back
to breakfast and to morning parade.
</p>

<p>
We passed the head of the olive valley, where the
poor Greek officer had been so barbarously executed;
and all the terrible scene of that morning came fresh
upon my memory.  In the distance lay the sea and
the grey rocks of Palegrossa, whereon was the rent
and gaping hull of the <i>Vestal</i>.
</p>

<p>
The atmosphere soon became oppressively
hot&mdash;singularly so for that season of the year, and
consequently I seldom saw the round visage, or heard the
guttural voice of the Yuze Bashi, save when he
stormed at a passing carrier, whose string of laden
mules raised a dust on the highway; or when he
swore at the terrified Boba of some wayside khan,
who was long in supplying him with sherbet or iced
water, for which supplies, by the way, he seldom
seemed to pay, save in threats and maledictions.
</p>

<p>
At one of these temporary halts near a khan, a
poor old Jew, wearing the blue turban and blue
boots enforced on those of his religion, approached
with great timidity, and with a humility which to
me&mdash;the son of a free soil&mdash;was painful and
oppressive, offered some cigars and tobacco for sale.
</p>

<p>
'Do not buy of him,' said Hussein, pulling sharply
back the curtains of his araba; 'he is a Jew, and
will cheat you&mdash;they are all cheats, believing that,
at most, they shall only endure for eleven months
the fires of hell&mdash;for such is their accursed creed.
Oho! is this you, Isaac Ebn Abraha, who keeps the
little booth in the new Frank street of Stamboul?'
</p>

<p>
'The same, at the service of my lord,' replied the
old Israelite, bending his white head.
</p>

<p>
'The gold of the English and French has been
rattling into your coffers like hailstones, I have been
told, Isaac?'
</p>

<p>
The Jew shook his head in dissent, and bent it
lower, to conceal his cunning eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Oho!  I lie, then, do I?' exclaimed this Turkish
bully; 'had other than you done this, I had smote
him on the mouth with the heel of my slipper!
Begone,' he added, spitting full in the cigar vender's
face.
</p>

<p>
I remonstrated, as a fierce gleam shot from the
hollow eyes of the old Jew, and he slunk away.
</p>

<p>
'Bah!' said the Yuze Bashi; 'we tolerate the
existence of Jews, Armenians, and Greeks, because, if
we destroyed them, what would the true Believers do
for slaves?'
</p>

<p>
'We meet few of them hereabout, at all events,'
said I; 'the whole country seems to become more
waste and barren as we advance.'
</p>

<p>
'True,' replied the puffing Osmanli, with a fierce
flashing in his dark eye, and a sardonic grin under his
grey moustache; '<i>where the Sultan's horse has trod there
grows no grass</i>.'
</p>

<p>
And, with this fatally true Turkish proverb, he
sank back among his downy cushions, and left me to
march on in silence or commune with Callum Dhu.
</p>

<p>
After passing Carga on our left, and Turcmeli on
our right, after crossing one or two streams, and
pursuing a road from which, upon our right flank, we
had bright glimpses of the blue sea of Marmora; after
passing many of those green tumuli, or old warrior-graves,
which stud all the land of Roumelia; after
seeing only flights of vultures, cranes, and storks, or
an occasional string of laden mules, progressing
towards Stamboul, a march of twenty miles found us
in a beautiful little valley, watered by a stream which
flowed from a fountain in the basement of a gilded
mosque, and surrounded by beautiful groves of pale
green olive-trees, the orange, and the mimosa, with
the crisped foliage of the dwarf oak, the broad and
luxuriant leaves of the wild vine, and the graceful
acacia, which Mohammed&mdash;in his 56th chapter&mdash;promises
shall bloom again in Paradise.
</p>

<p>
This was not far from Karacalderin, a small town
on the right flank of the coast road.
</p>

<p>
The grass was green and soft as velvet; a thousand
wild flowers studded its verdure, and loaded with
perfume the southern breeze that breathed up the
valley from the sea of Marmora, and proved to us all
delightful as a cold bath after our hot day's march.
</p>

<p>
Evening was approaching now; the giant poplars
and cypresses that surrounded the little mosque,
which marked where some dead Santon lay, were
throwing their lengthening shadows far across the
valley; and on my announcing that I would halt
here for the night, my soldiers gladly threw off their
knapsacks and piled their arms; Callum lighted a
large fire, with all the adroitness of a Highland
huntsman, and with some jest about there 'being
little chance of firing the heather <i>here</i>,' heaped on the
branches of the dwarf oaks, which we hewed
remorselessly down by our bill-hooks.
</p>

<p>
The Yuze Bashi, though he grumbled savagely
under his beard at the annoyance of having to halt
(as he feared to proceed alone through a district full
of armed and unscrupulous Greek peasantry), was
compelled to make the best of our delightful little
bivouac, and while my men made a meal of the cold
meat which had been brought in their haversacks, he
shared with me a cold pillaff of fowl and rice, and a
jolly magnum bonum of Kirklissa wine.
</p>

<p>
Discovering another in the recesses of the araba,
I abstracted it <i>sans ceremonie</i>, and despite all Hussein's
angry remonstrances, handed it to my soldiers, and as
it proved to be well dashed with brandy, they passed
it from man to man until each had his share, and then
they all began to talk, sing, and be merry.
</p>

<p>
'Bless their hearts!' says Charles Lever, 'a little
fun goes a long way in the army;' and any man who
has ever spent an hour in the company of soldiers
will find it so.
</p>

<p>
They were all happy as crickets round that bivouac
fire, for actual service softens cold etiquette, and
relaxes the iron band of discipline without impairing
it, especially among Scots and Irishmen; and while
the blaze of the ruddy flame shot upward, and tipped
the olive-trees with light as fresh fuel was heaped
upon it, while the orient sunset died away and
deepened into azure night, on the calm Grecian sea and
lovely classic shore, we sat in that romantic valley clad
in the same martial garb our hardy sires had worn in
the days of Remus and Romulus, telling old stories
of our native land, or singing those songs, which, when
we were so far away from it, made the hearts within
us melt to tenderness, or swell with pride and fire.
</p>

<p>
While the old, gross, and sensual Yuze Bashi lay
half hidden among the down cushions of his araba
and dozed away over his narguillah of rose-water, I
sang a mess-room stave or two to amuse my men;
and by doing so won their hearts still more, I am
assured, than even my previous and studied kindness
to them had done.  Then I called on Callum Dhu for
his quota of amusement, and at once his fine bold
manly voice made the valley ring, as he gave us that
fiery song in which his warlike ancestor, Ian Lom
Mac Donel, the Bard of Keppoch, has embalmed the
victory of the great Montrose at Inverlochy.
</p>

<p>
He sang it in his native Gaelic, and as he poured
it forth his swarthy cheek was seen to glow and his
eyes to flash&mdash;ay, even the muscles of his bare legs,
on which fell the glow of the wavering watch-fire,
seemed to quiver and be strung anew with energy as
all the fire of Ian Lom filled the heart of his
descendant&mdash;for through (my nurse) his mother, Callum
came of Ian's race.
</p>

<p>
The song cannot be known to my English readers;
but as it is in that bold ballad style they love so well,
I may be pardoned in quoting two verses of it from
a little historical work that may never cross the
Tweed;[*] and as he sang, the voices of his thirty
comrades united with singular force and harmony in
the chorus:&mdash;
</p>

So intent were we on the song&mdash;so much had it
absorbed our faculties and fixed our hearts and eyes,
that we had not heard the challenge of Donald Roy,
who was stationed as a sentinel near the road; nor
until its conclusion did we perceive that a stranger
had joined us, and was standing propped upon a long
and knotty staff, surveying us with eyes of wonder,
and with an interest that was not unfriendly, for a
smile lighted all his features as I rose to greet him.
on recognising the wandering Moolah Moustapha,
whom I had met at the Khan in Heraclea, and who
had officiated on the morning when the Greek
Lieutenant, Constantine Vidimo, was shot.

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXVIII.
<br /><br />
THE VISION OF CORPORAL MOUSTAPHA.
</h3>

<p>
He accorded to us the usual greeting, and contrary
to the use and wont of ignorant Dervishes and Moolahs,
who dislike soldiers in general and infidels in
particular, he seated himself by our fire and partook
at once of some bread and meat which were offered
him by Callum, but shook his averted head when the
leathern flasks of wine and potent raki were held
towards him by Sergeant Mac Ildhui.
</p>

<p>
'Nay, nay,' said he, 'wine and gaming are alike
forbidden by the Koran&mdash;yet there was a time when
I was daily and nightly addicted to both.'
</p>

<p>
'And when did you reform, reverend Moolah?' I
asked.
</p>

<p>
'When I ceased to be a soldier,' he answered with
a quiet smile.
</p>

<p>
'A soldier!' I reiterated; 'have <i>you</i> then been one
of ourselves?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Aga, and one who could handle <i>this</i> with the
best man among you,' he replied, snatching up a
musket and fixing and unfixing the bayonet with an
adroitness that none but a practised soldier can
achieve.  This old man was spare and brawny, quick
of speech and sharp in eye.  'Yes&mdash;I was a soldier
of Scherif Bey's regiment, and fought at the battles of
Ilonis, of Athens, and of Koniah.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, by the beard of the Prophet,' exclaimed the
Yuze Bashi, waking up suddenly; 'and you it was,
O most worthy Moustapha! who assisted me to save
the colours of the Scherif, by stuffing them into my
regimental breeches.  Mashallah! 'twas well, it was
not the standard of Islam, for where were the mortal
breeches which would have held <i>that</i>?'
</p>

<p>
'True, O gallant Yuze Bashi; and the same battle
of Koniah which made thy fortune on earth, while it
marred mine here, made it, I trust, in Paradise.'
</p>

<p>
'You were left on the field?' said Hussein.
</p>

<p>
'Pierced by a ball.'
</p>

<p>
'May dogs defile the grave of him who shot it!'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, nay, Hadjee Hussein, that bullet brought
light and repentance to me; for until that day so
fatal to the fortune of our lord the Sultan in Egypt,
I was a very wretch&mdash;an apostate&mdash;a scoffer&mdash;an
unbeliever in the prophet&mdash;yea, a veritable Janissary!'
</p>

<p>
'But a brave soldier, Hafiz Moustapha.'
</p>

<p>
'My lord is pleased to be merry.'
</p>

<p>
'By the night and all that it enfolds in its shades,
I am <i>not</i>, Moustapha!  I speak but the truth of you,
Hafiz.  You were ever a brave soldier as any in the
ranks of Islam&mdash;as any in the army of Mahmoud II.,
though somewhat of a visionary.'
</p>

<p>
The old Moolah crossed his hands upon his breast,
and bowed down his bearded face in reply.
</p>

<p>
'And did you see much of war and battles in those
days, reverend Moolah?' I asked.
</p>

<p>
'Enough and to spare.'
</p>

<p>
'Mashallah!' exclaimed Hussein, 'I have seen him
carrying six Egyptian heads at once by the top knot,
a handful of them all grasped like a cluster of gourds,
and I have seen him with four-and-twenty ears all
strung like herrings on his ramrod, when Egyptian
ears sold as high as ten paras each.  Beard of Khalid!
I have sent a bushel of them more than once to the
tent of Reschid Pasha.  Moustapha went hand in
hand with the wild Koords in roasting and impaling
our prisoners&mdash;for what are Egyptians but curs like
the Greeks?'
</p>

<p>
'Curs of a darker hue.'
</p>

<p>
'True, oh reverend Moolah&mdash;though it is said, if
thou wishest to please the eye, take a Circassian
maid; but if for pleasure and voluptuousness, try an
Egyptian one.'
</p>

<p>
'And did you tire of slaughter or of soldiering?'
I asked, not being naturalist enough to ponder long
over the last remark&mdash;a proverbial one in the East.
</p>

<p>
'Of neither, though I saw enough of both while
under Scherif Bey; but in my youth I was good and
pious, and knowing all the Koran and Bible by heart,
was styled <i>Hafiz</i>, which meaneth <i>Bible-reader</i>.  I became
a soldier, and fell into evil ways.  I had a vision&mdash;a
vision, O Frank! such as seldom opens up to mortal
eyes,' he continued, pointing upward, while his eyes
flashed with a red unearthly glare, and his whole face
flushed from his brow to his long white beard; 'and
from that hour I was a changed man.  I ceased to
regard the things of this life, or be solicitous of aught
on earth&mdash;where I should find food in the morning
or rest at night&mdash;looking forward only to death as the
gate through which I should pass to Paradise.  I was
once avaricious as a Jew, but now my heart is
expanded; all that the sun enlightens would I give in
charity, had it been mine.  I, who had been often red
to the elbows in the blood of slaughtered Greeks and
dark Egyptians, now shrank from blood as from a
flaming fire; I who had no more conscience than a
Bedouin of the desert, and less remorse than an
African savage, now see my sins of omission and
commission&mdash;all my deeds of sorrow and cruelty,
performed in the days of my ignorance and trouble,
rising like a stupendous column in the very path that
leads direct to the place of our abode&mdash;to the garden
of pleasure&mdash;the paradise of the blessed.  After the
battle of Koniah I was a changed man, yea changed
as if <i>the black drop of original sin had been wrung out of
my heart</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'Tell the Frankish officer the story, O Hafiz&mdash;my
old brother soldier; for though you were but an
onbashi and I a captain, I look back with pride
to the days when we unsheathed our swords in the
same field beneath the green banner of Beschid
Pasha,' said Hussein.
</p>

<p>
'The Frank may but mock me as the Ingleez do all
strangers,' said the old Moolah, with a species of
growl in his tone, as he glanced uneasily at my
soldiers, most of whom had already dropped asleep.
</p>

<p>
I laid a hand on my breast, and expressed a hope
that he would not think so meanly of me.
</p>

<p>
'No, no, I shall answer for him,' said the Yuze
Bashi; 'it ill becometh a young soldier to mock the
white beard of an old one.  Moreover, what sayeth the
Koran?  "O Unbelievers, I will not worship that
which ye worship, nor will ye worship that which I
worship.  Ye have your religion, and I have my
religion," and there is an end of it, say I, Hadjee
Hussein.  'Tis a story as well as another, and I
delight in stories&mdash;they always set me to sleep.'
</p>

<p>
'I will tell you in a few words,' replied the old
Moolah, adjusting his high conical cap of grey felt,
and disposing his mighty beard over the breast of his
robe; 'but I presume that you, O valiant Yuze Bashi,
have heard it before?'
</p>

<p>
'By the spout of the holy Kaaba, most reverend
Hafiz; and by the holy camel's blessed hump I never
did!' said the irritable Yuze Bashi, giving the coils
of his arguillah a kick, and smoking away at the
amber mouth-piece.
</p>

<p>
'It made noise enough in the camp of the Sultan's
troops.'
</p>

<p>
'Then I hope it may make a noise here too, for the
place is quiet enough,' retorted Hussein, who was in
a furious pet at all this unnecessary delay.
</p>

<p>
'You must know, O Frank!' began the Moolah,
'that I was a corporal in the third Orta or battalion
of Scherif Bey's regiment, in the army of the Grand
Vizier, Reschid Pasha, and warred against the
revolted Egyptians of Mehemet Ali; and was wounded
by a bayonet at Homs in the Pashalick of Damascus,
where we fought a desperate battle on the right bank
of the Orontes; I lost the tip of my right ear at the
battle of Athens when fighting against the Greeks, and
had a mouthful of teeth driven down my throat by a
half-spent Russian bullet at Navarino; but all these
wounds were as nothing when compared to one I
received at the fatal defeat of Koniah in Asia Minor,
where in the winter of 1247, by the reckoning of the
Hejira, Ibrahim Pasha, defeated Reschid and cast
everlasting disgrace on the banners of the Sultan.
</p>

<p>
'All his reverses in the Russian wars had failed to
teach generalship to Reschid Pasha, who, with the
fugitives of Homs, had halted at the thrice-blessed
city of Koniah, where a snow-covered plain of sixty
miles in extent gave ample room for the Osmanlies,
forty-five thousand in number, to fight the fifteen
thousand Egyptian curs at Ibrahim.  Brave to a
fault&mdash;for he was the son of a Koordish chief and a
Georgian slave&mdash;old Reschid led the charge of Horse,
which, by its failure, lost the battle.  Vain was the
fury of the Koordish Cavalry, and vain the fiery
valour of the bare-kneed Albanian Guard!  The battle
was lost by us, and the banner of the Sultan was trod
to the dust by the steeds of the desert.  All our cannon
were taken.  O day of calamities!&mdash;and all our
standards!'
</p>

<p>
'Except <i>one</i>,' urged Hussein, parenthetically.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, most valiant Yuze Bashi&mdash;except one, after
assisting you to save which, a musket-shot pierced
my breast, and, half-choked in my blood, I sank
powerless on the field; and on becoming faint,
remember no more of that unfortunate battle, though
its roar was so great that one might have supposed
all hell was being dragged by chains to judgment, as
the Prophet says, it shall be, on the great and
inevitable day.
</p>

<p>
'When consciousness returned, the sun was setting
beyond the snow-covered mountains, and faint and
blue their spotless cones rose like the waves of a
frozen sea around the distant walls of Koniah.  On
the gilded domes of its twelve great mosques, and the
hundred minars of its lesser shrines, fell the last rays
of that sinking sun; and full of thoughts of awe and
death, I turned me, in penitence and grief, from the
horrors of that lost battle-field, and bent my head in
prayer as the shrill cries of the muezzins reached me
from the tall steeples of the Sultan Selim and of
Sheik Ibrahim; and as I prayed, the dying sunset
faded on the snow-capped hills and gilded domes;
the minarets grew dark and cold, and ghastly
mountain-piles turned to purple tints as the night set in,
deep, calm, and beautiful.  The stars were sparkling
above the silent city and that dreadful battle-plain.
A painful and burning thirst oppressed me; and
while crawling towards a spring that bubbled near me
in the moonlight, I again became unconscious.
</p>

<p>
'Glory be to Allah and to his Prophet!  Amid that
unconsciousness or stupor which oppressed me there
came at times a sense of pain in my smarting wound,
and of thirst in my parched throat, while the gurgle
of the fresh, cool fountain sung drowsily in my ear,
like the murmur of a distant multitude.
</p>

<p>
'Recollection came again, and I saw the fountain
sparkling in the moonlight, which tipped with silver
the blue and white water-lilies, and every floweret,
leaf, and shrub, for all was bright and clear as in the
brightest and clearest noon.
</p>

<p>
'While gazing at the glittering water with longing
eyes, lo!  I suddenly beheld before me the beautiful
figure of a woman&mdash;a nymph lovely beyond all earthly
loveliness.  Dazzling as Ayesha, the best-beloved
wife of Mohammed, and fair as the rose of Cashmere,
her exquisite form, was discernible through the only
garment she wore, a slight cymar of green&mdash;the colour
sacred to the Prophet&mdash;and her smooth round limbs
were white as the driven snow.  Her slender neck,
her curved shoulders, and tapered arms, were modelled
in the most charming symmetry; a faint blush was on
her soft cheek, and the expression of her large dark
eyes was such as I dare not trust myself to describe,
for they possessed a lustre and a winning sweetness
which confused, fascinated, and bewildered me.  Long
and black as winter night, her glossy tresses fell
upon her white shoulders, and half shrouded her
swelling bosom.
</p>

<p>
'The air around her was filled with delicious
perfume.  She spoke to me; but for a time I knew not
what she said; for with her voice there seemed to
come a stream of gentle music from a distance; and
by its melody I was filled with a rapture such as
never fired my soul, or swept my nerves before.
</p>

<p>
'Her sparkling eyes were full of conscious power;
her radiant smile was full of conscious loveliness,
tempered by all the pride of purity and innocence;
for know, O Frank! that she who stood before me
was one of the Hûr al Oyn&mdash;the black-eyed girls of
Paradise&mdash;the ever-blooming brides of the faithful,
though I knew it not then; but imagined&mdash;sinner that
I was!&mdash;that some Naide of old, or some lascivious
goddess of the lying Greeks had come to earth again.
</p>

<p>
'"Moustapha," said the maiden, "thou shalt not be
one of those who will perish in this world and pass
away with it on that day when the mighty hills shall
roll like smoke before the dreadful wind, that is to
blow from the east."
</p>

<p>
'"How, O beautiful one?" I asked, while trembling
with a more than mortal joy.
</p>

<p>
'"Because, know, Hafiz Moustapha, that the blessed
finger of the Prophet is on thee."
</p>

<p>
'"Upon me&mdash;a mite&mdash;an atom!"
</p>

<p>
'"He remembereth the leaves of the forest, O Hafiz! and
the grains of sand on the sea-shore.  He is the
father of all wisdom."
</p>

<p>
'"I am but a poor corporal of foot," said I, remembering
the rattan of our adjutant, which I had felt
more often than the finger of the Prophet.
</p>

<p>
'"A weak mortal, assuredly&mdash;but a true Believer."
</p>

<p>
'"Bechesm!  Upon thy beautiful eyes be it, that I
am."
</p>

<p>
'A fire seemed to rage within me, and I strove to
reach and embrace her; but in vain, for lo! there
suddenly rose around her a hedge of thorns and
brambles&mdash;the fuel of hell&mdash;that pricked and tore my
heated flesh.
</p>

<p>
'The maiden smiled with all her alluring sweetness
of lips and eyes, and almost laughed as she held up a
beautiful hand to deprecate my folly; while the
wound in my breast caused me almost to swoon with
a sudden pang of agony.
</p>

<p>
'"What is your name?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
'"Noura."
</p>

<p>
'"Which meaneth&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'"Light."
</p>

<p>
'"And why without garments?"
</p>

<p>
'"Because garments are a sign of the disobedience
of our first parents, and in our blessed abode that
disobedience is forgotten.  Al Araf separates us from
those by whom it is remembered with sorrow, and
wailing, and gnashing of teeth.  Think, O Hafiz
Maustapha, think of what is before thee!  Thou hast
neglected alms, and scoffed at prayer; blinded by vice,
thou hast forgotten all about punishment hereafter;
and intoxicated by the grosser pleasures of earth, thou
hast dared to doubt those which were to come, yet
vaunted thyself a true Mussulman&mdash;being a liar and a
hypocrite, even as Abdallah Elen Obba was a liar and
a hypocrite before thee."
</p>

<p>
'At these words a deadly terror fell upon my soul,
for the eyes of the maiden gleamed with a lurid light
as she spoke.  I wept and said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'"What shall I do, O lovely one, to merit Paradise?"
</p>

<p>
'"Fear the Holy Prophet&mdash;keep his laws&mdash;and love
me."
</p>

<p>
'"Love <i>you</i>!" I said, and stretched my arms in
ecstasy towards her; but, with a cry of astonishment
and despair, as her figure melted away and I saw
only the cold fountain plashing in the pale moonlight.
Then there descended upon me a darkness and a
horror, amid which I felt a soft hand grasping mine
with a touch that thrilled me, and the voice of Noura
whispered in my ear&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'"Come, Moustapha, come!  Ascend to Paradise,
where two-and-seventy such as I await thee with
smiles and with impatience."
</p>

<p>
'Now by all the devils that shaved the Queen of
Saba!' shouted the irreverend Yuze Bashi; 'think
of that! two-and-seventy wives all to be had for mere
belief, which costs nothing, when I have paid a thousand
xerifs, and not an asper less, for one Circassian,
in my lifetime.'
</p>

<p>
'Peace!' exclaimed the moolah, with a brow and
tone of severity; 'peace, Hussein Ebn al Ajuz; or,
by the souls of the seven lawgivers, I shall cease.
Allah is indeed most merciful that he does not smite
thee deaf, and dumb, and blind.
</p>

<p>
'In a moment, grief, pain, and darkness passed away&mdash;and
light, music, and perfume, with a myriad brilliant
figures and objects, all beaming with a celestial
glory, were around me.  Then a holy joy filled all
my soul, for I knew that I had left the earth, with its
petty cares and wretched vanities, far, far away below
the seven heavens and the mansions of the moon;
and that now the Garden of the Blessed&mdash;the Eden
of old&mdash;the Januat al Ferdaws of the Faithful&mdash;was
before me.
</p>

<p>
'O Mahmoud resoul Allah!  May the angels of
victory sweep away the dust from beneath thy feet,
and may their wings shield all who believe in thee!
O strange it is that I should have seen these things,
and yet live to speak of them on earth!
</p>

<p>
'I was in that wondrous Garden of Paradise from
which our first parents were expelled, when Adam,
was hurled downward on the Isle of Serendib,[*] where
his footmark yet remains upon a mountain-top; and
when Eve fell near Mecca, where the marks of her
two knees, as she knelt, are yet to be seen, sixty
musket-shot apart, for their stature was gigantic.
After that prodigious fall, they were separated two
hundred years, for the vast earth was all a silent
desert then.  But to resume:

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Had it not been promised that he who looks on
Paradise becomes endued with the strength of a
hundred of the strongest men, I must have sunk
under the scenes of more than mortal splendour,
pleasure, and delight that passed before my
bewildered senses; for, as the Koran sayeth, they were
such things <i>as eye hath not seen, ear hath not heard, nor
the heart of man conceived</i>.
</p>

<p>
'I was in an ecstasy!  A blessed ardour&mdash;a glorious
joy swelled all my heart with love, religion, and
purity.  A brilliant halo was around me&mdash;a light
without cloud&mdash;as in Khorassan, the land of the Sun,
and nothing that is there has a shadow, for light
is everywhere.
</p>

<p>
'After passing a lake of brilliant water, that was
whiter than milk, a month's journey in compass, and
surrounded by as many goblets as there are stars in
the firmament&mdash;each goblet formed of a single
emerald, and containing a liquid so precious that he who
drinks thereof shall never thirst more, I was ushered
by two shining angels through seven lofty gates,
in seven walls that were built of sparkling diamonds
and gleaming rubies, into the Jannat al Ferdaws, or
abode of the blessed.  At the seventh I was clothed
in the richest robes of silk and brocade, chiefly of a
green colour; and these robes, like the bracelets of
gold and silver, and the crown of mighty pearls with
which they encompassed my brows, were taken from
the full-bursting flowers of Paradise that grew on
each side of the way by which we journeyed.  Before
me went a long train of shadowy slaves, bearing
silken carpets, litters, soft couches, downy pillows,
and other furniture&mdash;each article being embroidered
with more precious stones than all Asia could furnish
in a thousand years.
</p>

<p>
'After a feast such as Mohammed alone could conceive,
for the <i>lobe</i> of a single fish on that wondrous
table would dine seventy thousand hungry Ingleez,
I was conducted along garden-walks of musk and
amber; the earth of the parterre seemed like the
finest wheaten flour, and therein grew all the flowers
of Paradise&mdash;each parterre being lovelier than all
Suristan, the Land of Roses; for the leaves were of
emeralds, the buds and petals of rubies, the stalks of
burnished gold, and the slender twigs of polished
silver, all gleaming and glittering under a stupendous
blaze of sunlight.
</p>

<p>
'Passing kiosks of golden wire entwined with
roses, wherein were youths and damsels in amorous
dalliance; passing the mighty Toaba&mdash;the tree of
happiness, which bears all the fruits, and meats, and
food the world ever knew, with a myriad others all
of tastes unknown to mortals, and every leaf of which
is a melodious tongue, and the stem of which would
take the swiftest Barbary steed a thousand years to
compass; passing fountains of water, milk, honey, and
wine, all flowing on pebbles of ruby and pearl, through
beds of camphire, saffron, and amber&mdash;-I was led
on&mdash;on&mdash;through shrubberies of precious stones and
golden-bodied trees, on every branch of which hung a thousand
little bells, and there sat a thousand singing-birds,
which united with the leaves of the Toaba in filling
the air with divine praises and bewildering
harmony&mdash;on&mdash;on&mdash;until we reached a pavilion hollowed and
fashioned of a single pearl, no less than four parasangs
broad, and nearly sixty Turkish miles in length&mdash;every
part of it, without and within, gleaming with
sentences from the Koran, written in rubies and jacinths.
</p>

<p>
'Here stood eighty thousand slaves, all clad in
shining garments, and three hundred beautiful
damsels, each bearing three hundred golden and porcelain
dishes, each dish containing three hundred kinds of
food, awaited me on bended knees, with their charming
faces bowed to the silken carpets; three hundred
others bore precious vessels filled with fragrant wine;
and in what language, O Frank, shall I refer to the
two-and-seventy wives, the Houris, who awaited me
there, each reclining in her couch, hollowed of a
single pearl&mdash;the Hûr al Oyn, the black-eyed,
high-bosomed girls of Paradise, who are created not of
clay, like mortal women, but of the purest musk, and
are without blemish&mdash;maidens on whose faces of
celestial beauty none may look and live without a
miracle; for I seemed to see all at a glance, though
the Prophet says, these things would take the most
faithful of men a thousand years' journey to behold.[*]

'Each coach whereon a maiden lay was a throne
glorious as that of Solomon, the Star of the Genii;
and each Houri had no other veil to her naked
loveliness than the flowing tresses of her perfumed and
shining hair.
</p>

<p>
'As my dazzled eyes swept round this vast apartment,
they lighted on a familiar form; it was that of
Noura, the nymph of the fountain; and as I
recognised her, she stretched her snowy arms towards me,
with her soft alluring smile, as the fire of love and
conscious beauty lit up her large black eyes.  Her
light etherial blood coursed through her veins; I
hung in rapture over her, and half faint with joy
and agitation, clasped her to my breast.
</p>

<p>
'Then the curtains of the pavilion fell around us,
drawn by unseen hands, and the voices of the singing-trees,
the golden birds, and fairy bells without, became
hushed or died away, as I sank entranced upon
the tender bosom that panted under mine; and when
impressing upon her warm lip the first kiss that man
had ever printed there, lo! a sleep fell upon me&mdash;a
deep and dreamless sleep&mdash;O Mahmoud resoul
Allah! that I should ever have awakened from it!'

<p>
The moolah paused in great excitement; the perspiration
stood upon his wrinkled forehead, and rolled
over the glistening hairs of his snowy beard; his
dark eyes glared with a hollow gleam, and his breath
came thick and fast.
</p>

<p>
'Proceed, moolah,' said Hussein, quietly, amid a
puff of smoke; 'and you awakened, where?'
</p>

<p>
'On the verge of the snow-covered battle-field of
Koniah, and close beside the fountain where I had
fallen into a swoon; the chill dews of night were
upon me, the bright clear moon rode through its
loftiest mansions; the pale fountain was murmuring
and plashing on its pebbled bed beside me; the lotus
was drooping on its stalk; I was still accoutred as a
soldier&mdash;a poor corporal of Scherif Bey, and my
hand rested on the cold, hard barrel of my musket.
</p>

<p>
'Paradise and all its glories had vanished with the
sleep that sealed my eyes!
</p>

<p>
'Again I was a poor soldier, lying bruised on that
lost and moonlit battle-field, with the dew and the
cold hoar frost whitening upon me.
</p>

<p>
'Bismillah!
</p>

<p>
'Slowly I staggered up, and felt for the wound in
my breast&mdash;and O, wonder of wonders!  Though my
blue uniform was still perforated by the passage of
the ball, the blood had disappeared, and the wound
had closed; it was well and whole&mdash;and of all that
bloody gash, a little scar alone remained!
</p>

<p>
'I threw myself upon the earth towards the
Keblah&mdash;the Holy City of Mecca; and I vowed seven
times&mdash;by the seven gates of Paradise&mdash;by the souls
of the seven lawgivers&mdash;and by all the lights of the
faithful&mdash;to become a good, a pious, and a new man;
and from that hour I ceased to be a soldier, a reveller,
a dicer, and a gamester; I became a moolah, and went
through all Greece and Asia Minor, preaching the
faith of the Koran and of the only Prophet&mdash;Mahmoud
resoul Allah&mdash;for there is no God but God, and
the Camel Driver is his Prophet!'

<h3>
CHAPTER XXXIX.
<br /><br />
THE TURKISH VEIL.
</h3>

<p>
With this strange story hovering in my mind, and
the Yuze Bashi asleep in the cushioned recess of his
araba, I paraded and marched off my detachment from
the valley at the first peep of early dawn next day.
I bade farewell to the old moolah Moustapha&mdash;the
ex-corporal of Scherif Bey&mdash;and gave him one of the
small Turkish notes (which are printed on thin yellow
paper, and are worth about ten shillings sterling) for
the benefit of his mosque; and feared that if he was
not slightly defective in brain, he had at least but
a slight acquaintance with the goddess whose
billet is popularly said to be at the bottom of a
well.
</p>

<p>
Along a road bordered by rare plants and gorgeous
flowers; between groves of orange, lemon, and fig
trees, all growing in wild luxuriance, and among
myrtle-scented fields, we continued our march by
the shore of the sea of Marmora, the voices of my
thirty soldiers all uniting at times in one merry
chorus, as they trod the old paved causeway of the
great Sultan Solymon, many of whose works are, by
the ignorant, ascribed to the Genii&mdash;just as our
Scottish peasantry aver their old ruins to be the work of
Picts or of the fairies&mdash;and before mid-day, we saw
the little town of Rodosdchig rise before us, with
the blue sea washing its old grey walls; with its dark
cypresses and white minarets; its harbour full of
quaint caiques; and its old castle of the Greeks, on
which was the red Turkish standard, with an oval
centre, bearing the three crescents of the Prophet.
</p>

<p>
As we marched in, the drum beat at the guard-house,
and a guard of lubberly Turkish militiamen
scrambled from around a logwood fire, where they
had been toasting kabobs and dough-balls; they stood
to their arms, and gave us a military salute.  The
officer at their head still retained at his neck the
ancient gilt gorget, now long disused in our service.
</p>

<p>
We were immediately beset by Greek kabob-roasters,
and sherbet-venders, from the arched gates
of the bazaars, and a crowd of wondering Osmanlies,
whom the strange sound of the Highland warpipe
brought forth from every door, where they had been
squatted on carpets, dozing over opium, coffee, and
chibouques; yet though louder, more martial, and
more shrill, our pipe is almost similar to the
instrument now used by the kilted mountaineers of
Albania.
</p>

<p>
Not a woman was visible, though at times a veiled
head and two brilliant eyes appeared at the wire
lattices which opened to the unpaved and unlighted
streets.
</p>

<p>
We marched into the old castle, of which the Yuze
Bashi was commandant, governor, or suzerain, and as
such was the terror of all Rodosdchig.  He was the
only officer there at present, though the quaint old
Greek towers of the last emperor were garrisoned by
his company of Bombardiers, and were mounted by
ten iron twenty-four pounders and two ten-inch
mortars.  On the walls towards the sea were several
old and useless, but enormous, brass guns, covered
with Turkish letters and pious sentences, with piles
of moss-grown marble shot between them.  The
stockades in many places had disappeared, for our
thrifty commandant had sold them when his piastres
became scarce, to the kabob-roasters, for firewood.
</p>

<p>
On resuming his command, the first act of Hussein
was to cudgel&mdash;almost to death&mdash;the chaoush of the
main-guard, for some real or imaginary fault; an act
which gave us an odd idea of Turkish discipline.
</p>

<p>
'What think you of this, Callum?' said I, with
smile; 'suppose an officer were to cudgel you?'
</p>

<p>
'I would drive my skene into his heart with as
little remorse as I would gralloch a dead deer,'
was the reply of my henchman, frowning at the
idea.
</p>

<p>
My men occupied a portion of the miserable
Turkish barrack, and I had rooms assigned to me in
a tower, the windows of which faced the sea; and as
the furniture was furnished by the government of His
Majesty the Sultan, it could scarcely be expected to
be much more luxurious than the birch-table, two
Windsor-chairs, the iron coal-box and elegant pair of
bellows usually issued from the stores of Her
Brittanic Majesty to an officer in garrison.
</p>

<p>
That evening I dined&mdash;or supped&mdash;which you
please (for the hour rendered the meal dubious)&mdash;with
the Yuze Bashi, whose portion of the castle was
magnificently fitted up.  His servants were black
slave girls.  We had neither forks, chairs, nor a
table.  We sat on cushions, and ate pillaff and paties
of Gallipoli oysters with our fingers, from platters
placed on little stools; we tore the fragrant kabobs
from their wooden skewers with our teeth&mdash;rent the
fowls asunder by the simple process of inserting the
finger and thumb; drank sherbet of sugar and musk
dashed with French brandy; then came iced Grecian
wine, and, lighting our pipes, we gave thanks to the
Prophet for the good things of this land, and subsided
among the silken cushions with a sigh of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
By the inquiring Callum Dhu I was given to
understand that my friend the Yuze Bashi had a wife;
but, as it would have been discourteous to have asked
for her, as he studiously avoided ever recurring to
the circumstance of her existence; and, moreover, as
a Turk can never introduce his wife to any man save
a most intimate friend, and then only on receiving
his solemn word of honour never to mention so
singular a departure from the established Mohammedan
custom, I had no hope of being blessed by
seeing even the slipper of the commandant's earthly
helpmate; and so I thought no more about it&mdash;besides,
wives are most brittle and perilous ware to
meddle with in Turkey.
</p>

<p>
Several weeks passed away monotonously at the
castle of Rodosdchig.  I soon knew every street,
bazaar, mosque, bezestien, coffee-house, khan, and
kabobki in the place as well as if they were my own
property; the old Greek ruins in the neighbourhood;
the dumpy Doric columns of what had been a temple,
when beauty was worshipped in Thessaly and Thrace,
lying among a wilderness of luxurious weeds and
plants, with the snakes crawling over them, had all
been, again and again, delineated in my sketchbook;
the round towers of the old castle that overhung the
sea; the sea itself, with its Greek caiques, Turkish
xebeques, and quaint fisherboats, soon became as
familiar to me as the murmur of its waves on the
lucks below my barrack-room window.
</p>

<p>
To divert my ennui, fortunately for myself, as my
after-adventures proved, I applied all my energies to
the study of the monotonous and crack-jaw gibberish
of the Turks; and, with the assistance of 'Madden's
Grammar,' &amp;c., was able to master the sonnets of the
old Pasha, or General, Sermet Effendi; and of Partiff,
whose rhymes in honour of the Sultan and of Omar
Pasha are to be seen gilded above the gates of all the
edifices erected by the Government; Jachiened, the
<i>Gulistan</i>, or 'Rose Garden of Sadi of Shiraz,' and the
'Pleasing Tales of Khoja (Master) Nazir-il-adeen
Efendi;' and I still remember one charming old
Persian story of the Garden of Paradise, which was
described as being <i>still extant</i> in Asia, but concealed
among remote and inaccessible mountains, and to be
reached only through long caverns and by a
subterranean river; and therein were ever summer bloom
and floral beauty, and all the animals were tame and
loving, as before the fall of our first parents&mdash;the
lamb lying down beside the lion, and the panther
beside the goat, as some old dervish, who&mdash;like my
friend the corporal&mdash;had been there, called upon
every hair in his silver beard to testify.
</p>

<p>
The morning and evening parades of my little
party followed each other in unvarying succession;
but the riotous, bloodthirsty, and insurrectionary
Greeks, of whom the Yuze Bashi had spoken so
much at our mess in Heraclea, were as quiet as the
plodding denizens of the most rural district in
England.
</p>

<p>
The bluff Yuze Bashi Hussein (may his shadow
never be less!) was now my crowning bore, and I
soon saw enough of him to make me avoid his friendship,
and to inspire me with a dislike for him, still
stronger than even the story of the Greek Lieutenant
Vidimo had done.
</p>

<p>
Though the rent of his government, exclusive of
his pay, was one hundred and twenty purses, or
about 600<i>l.</i> per annum, Hussein had a large garden,
which he forced the soldiers of the Sultan to
cultivate, and the produce of which he sold to the
inhabitants <i>at his own prices</i>, which were always rising and
never falling.  By this means he nearly doubled his
pay; while, by selling the powder and shot of the
batteries to Levant coasters and Greek pirates, he
nearly trebled it; and then, to make up the deficiency
at head quarters, the returns of his garrison for
'ball-practice' were enormous.
</p>

<p>
Then he had secured a handsome sum for the head
of his younger brother, which, like a good and loyal
servant of the Prophet's earthly shadow, he had
transmitted to the Seraglio gate in a jar of salt; for
this unlucky brother, having fled from Stamboul,
where he had been engaged in an intrigue with a lady
of the Household, and having wounded the Kislar
Aga with his handjiar, became well worth a thousand
piastres, dead or alive.
</p>

<p>
Such was Hussein Ebn al Ajuz.  He was a man
utterly devoid of scruple or principle.
</p>

<p>
'A Greek,' said he, 'once dared to dispute with
me on religion&mdash;but I soon silenced him.'
</p>

<p>
'How?' I asked.
</p>

<p>
'By running my handjiar into his heart.'
</p>

<p>
'The devil!&mdash;that was a convincing argument.'
</p>

<p>
'A <i>sharp</i> one, at all events,' was the cool reply.
</p>

<p>
He made his hatred of the Greeks a never-failing
source of revenue.  If a merchant of that humbled
race gave an entertainment, and our commandant was
not invited, he would send an onbashi and three
soldiers, with fixed bayonets, to extinguish the lights,
disperse the guests, and bring before him the master
of the house, who was therefore ordered to pay down
so many piastres, as a fine, for disturbing the
neighbourhood&mdash;for the ponderous Turk is lord of the soil,
while the lively and more intelligent Greek is but its
serf and villein&mdash;being what the Englishman was to
the Norman knight eight hundred years ago.
</p>

<p>
I avoided the Yuze Bashi, no difficult matter, as he
spent half the day, seated on a carpet in a corner,
smoking his bubbling narguillah and drinking
brandy-and-water; and now having no resource but my own
thoughts, or Callum Dhu, whose conversation was
generally of old and regretful memories, my spirits
began to sink, for I had no longer the daily good
fellowship of our merry little mess, or the frank
joviality of Jack Belton to bear me up.  Left thus
entirely to myself in that gloomy old castle of the
Greeks, my mind reverted to other days and other
scenes, and the face of Laura&mdash;lost to me for
ever!&mdash;came frequently before me with a distinctness that
made my heart ache, though I sought&mdash;but in vain&mdash;to
thrust the painful thought and winning image from me.
</p>

<p>
One evening, according to my usual wont since I
had become wayward and moody, alone (as Callum
was on guard), but accoutred with my claymore,
dirk, and loaded revolver (for in this district
nobody ventures abroad unarmed), I wandered beyond
the walls of Rodosdchig, to a grove of cypresses, where
the wild grapes grew in luxuriance, and where I
could pluck them with the dew of evening on their
purple clusters.  A little farther on lay one of those
quiet Mohammedan cemeteries which are so poetically
named by the Orientals the Cities of the Silent.
There the ghost of each true Believer is supposed by
the superstitious to sit invisibly at the head of its own
grave.
</p>

<p>
Near this burial-place were the ruins of what had
been an old Greek hermitage, in the days when poor
anchorites 'sought to merit heaven' by drinking cold
water and chewing dry peas.
</p>

<p>
On this evening the City of the Silent rang with
the merry voices of a group of Turkish ladies.  Clad
in bright-coloured dresses, they were sitting on
carpets, among the green resting places, drinking sherbet,
eating <i>bon-bons</i>, and smoking pretty little chibouques,
while a few slaves and sullen eunuchs hovered near
them in attendance.  As I passed these veiled fair
ones, I heard a few shrill exclamations of wonder,
while their dark rolling eyes seemed to sparkle with
peculiar lustre through the holes in their snow-white
yashmacks.
</p>

<p>
On the verge of this cemetery, and apart from the
group, I passed a solitary lady, who was culling a
bouquet of flowers from among the turbanned headstones;
and who, in pursuit of this innocent object,
had wandered to some distance from her companions.
Attracted by the singular grace which pervaded all
her actions, I hovered near her, and affected to read
the epitaphs gilded on the marble tombs; but
perceiving that her bracelet&mdash;which was composed of
those magnificent opals which dart fire, and by the
Orientals are believed to be found only where thunder
has fallen&mdash;was lying on the grass, I hastened to
restore it, and to clasp it on her wrist.  With a hurried
bow, and a sweet smile sparkling in her eyes, she
permitted me to perform this little act; and while
doing so, I was charmed by the delicate beauty of
her arm and gloveless hand.
</p>

<p>
The bracelet was clasped, and I was on the point
of touching my cap and retiring, when, either by
accident or design&mdash;from all I knew of Turkish
wives, I half suspected <i>the latter</i>&mdash;her bouquet fell
from her hand, and the flowers were scattered about
her.
</p>

<p>
'Mashallah!' she exclaimed, and laughed.
</p>

<p>
Though I knew well that if seen near her, or with
her, a dose of bamboo-canes or a bullet, perhaps,
might repay my temerity, I deliberately gathered up
the flowers, and tieing them with a ribbon, presented
them to her, with a few Turkish compliments, and
begged permission to retain a rose, as a gift from her.
</p>

<p>
She at once accorded it, giving me, at the same
time, a full, deep, and piercing glance through the
square opening of her yashmack.
</p>

<p>
Oh, those speaking eyes!  How well this woman
knew their dangerous power!
</p>

<p>
I see them yet in imagination, for heaven never
created aught more beautiful than the eyes of this
Turkish damsel.  She touched my hand slightly, and
said, while casting a hurried glance about her,
</p>

<p>
'Where shall we meet again?'
</p>

<p>
The '<i>we</i>' made my heart leap!
</p>

<p>
'Meet again?&mdash;at this hour to-morrow evening&mdash;among
these ruins,' said I, entering recklessly into
what might prove a dangerous rendezvous; and then,
waving a kiss to me, my beautiful Unknown hurried
through the cypress-grove and rejoined her gay
companions.
</p>

<p>
It was all arranged and over in a moment!

<h3>
CHAPTER XL.
<br /><br />
A LOVE ADVENTURE.
</h3>

<p>
The next day passed slowly, and I thought of my
love affair&mdash;(for a love affair I had determined to
consider it)&mdash;with some anxiety: the path to Cupid
in the East being strewn with more daggers than
roses; for a panther in its hungry wrath is a lamb
when contrasted to a Turk animated by a fit of
jealousy; and that my unknown was the better-half of
some dreamy Osmanli I had not the least doubt.  I
carefully loaded my revolver&mdash;placed all my money
in my purse, to be ready for any emergency, and
buckled on my dirk and claymore, as if I had been
about to escalade the Malakoff or make a dash at the
Redan, instead of merely meeting a pretty girl.  I
then set forth to keep my appointment, just as the
Yuze Bashi was dropping off into his usual evening
doze, and just as the long shadows of the towers and
cypresses were falling to the eastward; and the
muezzins on the upper galleries of the minarets were
watching for the first dip of the sun's flaming disc, to
shout the shrill summons to evening prayer.
</p>

<p>
Had I forgotten Laura?
</p>

<p>
Alas for the weakness of the human heart!  I fear
that after I saw my beautiful Oriental I had no
memory for aught beyond that epoch in my history&mdash;for
a time at least.
</p>

<p>
Though the evening was delightful, few persons
were abroad; and after leaving the town, an old,
white-bearded Grecian monk, wending his way staff
in hand and wallet on back, was the only person I
met; as with a beating heart I sought the sequestered
ruins of the ancient Christian chapel and hermitage.
</p>

<p>
Once or twice a fear that I might have been lured
here for some deadly purpose, and that her
rendezvous was but a wicked snare, flashed upon me.
</p>

<p>
The scene was beautiful.  On one hand lay the
cemetery with its grove of tall and solemn cypresses;
on the other rose a marble rock surrounded by an old
rampart, having ruined towers, from which the cannon
of the Greeks had poured their stone-shot upon the
fierce Timariots of the Sultan Mohammed the Second,
the founder of the new Empire.  Amid these old
ramparts the antique outline of a gilt dome and the
white minar of a little mosque cut the evening sky.
At the base of the rock a stream flowed from a ruined
arch into a marble basin, over which flourished the
beautiful leaves of the acanthus, under the shade of
the graceful and delicate olive-tree.
</p>

<p>
The sun was setting with gorgeous brilliance; the
western sky was all a lurid red, as if the whole
horizon was in flames, and the shadows of three gigantic
Grecian Doric columns of white marble&mdash;ascribed
to the Genii in the times of old&mdash;were thrown far
across the landscape.  From the shattered cornice
and four triglyphs which still surmounted them,
some long and pendant creeping plants swung like
garlands on the evening wind, that came from the
deep and blue Propontis.
</p>

<p>
The shadows began to deepen; the horizon paled.
The birds had ceased to sing; but the little snakes
were hissing vigorously under the broad leaves of the
acanthus and the dewy lentisuculus&mdash;for in ten
minutes night would be on.
</p>

<p>
There was a sound; and my unknown, in her
white yashmack and flowing robes, came before me
like a graceful spirit, and quite as suddenly.  Her
hands were placed joyously and confidingly in mine,
and her eyes&mdash;the loveliest of all those dark and
soul-lit oriental eyes that seem to swim in their own
lustrous glory&mdash;were beaming upon me.  I was
bewildered&mdash;confused&mdash;dazzled!
</p>

<p>
I felt the impossibility of resisting the fascinations
of two such loving eyes.  The inside of the delicate
lids were blackened with kohol, and the ends of her
slender fingers were tinged with rosyhenna&mdash;yet she
spoke with somewhat of a Greek accent.
</p>

<p>
'Tell me your name, my beautiful one?' I whispered,
retaining her soft hands in mine.
</p>

<p>
'Iola,' was the half-breathed reply.
</p>

<p>
'Iola&mdash;anything more?'
</p>

<p>
'Mashallah! what more would you require me to say?'
</p>

<p>
'Do you live in Rodosdchig?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;but why do you inquire?'
</p>

<p>
'Because all that concerns you must be full of
tender interest to me.'
</p>

<p>
'So soon!  You have not known me quite five
minutes.'
</p>

<p>
'I have known you four and twenty hours; yet
when I gaze into your beautiful eyes, Iola, I seem to
have known you for a life-time.'
</p>

<p>
'You love me then?' she exclaimed, as her large
eyes filled with light and merriment.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Iola! who could see you without loving you,
tenderly and passionately?'
</p>

<p>
'Inshallah!'
</p>

<p>
'You are not a Turk?
</p>

<p>
'Turk&mdash;no!  I am a Greek,' she answered, in a
changed voice, and drooping of the eyelid.
</p>

<p>
I attempted to remove her yashmack; but she
exclaimed,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'In the name of Allah, not yet&mdash;not yet!' and
shrinking laughingly back, with pretty coquetry,
prevented me from doing so.
</p>

<p>
After a little flirtation, and permitting me to kiss
her hands as often as I pleased, from a few words she
let fall, greatly to my alarm, I suspected that she <i>was</i>
a married Moselema; but I was now too much involved
with her to 'hang fire,' as we say at mess;
and too much attracted by her beauty&mdash;though I had
seen but little of it&mdash;to relinquish the chance of
enlivening my dull detachment duty by a little love
affair&mdash;though death, perhaps, should hover near it.
The imminent risk we ran enhanced the charm of this
new acquaintance.  The darkness was deepening, for
in these climates there is little twilight; and alarmed
by the sombre aspect of the ruins, which were
haunted, of course, by a Ghoule, Iola (a charming
name!); started from my side, and insisted on retiring.
</p>

<p>
'Take these three rose-buds,' said I, for flowers
are the language of love among the Asiatics; 'three
on one stem.  Iola&mdash;they are emblematic of the three
qualities of love.'
</p>

<p>
'Of love?' she reiterated, in a tremulous whisper.
</p>

<p>
'Sprightly, secret, and sincere love, as ours shall
be.  Will you accept of them from me?'
</p>

<p>
She trembled like one about to do a guilty thing;
but took them with a blush and something like a sob
of joy; yet this excitable little one would not permit
me to kiss her!
</p>

<p>
'You will wear them for my sake, Iola?'
</p>

<p>
'There is danger in doing so&mdash;yet I will treasure
them even when faded, like the jewel of Prince
Giamschid; and what is my reward?'
</p>

<p>
'Your reward?' I faltered, while reddening in turn.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, for the danger.'
</p>

<p>
'One dear little kiss&mdash;or a thousand if you will let
me give them!' I exclaimed, and threw my arm round
her.
</p>

<p>
She drew down the yashmack, and I pressed my
lip to hers, again and again.
</p>

<p>
Until this moment my Oriental had never perhaps
known what love was.  Risk, life, death, all were
forgotten!  I remembered only the charm and the
opportunity.
</p>

<p>
'And so in Frankistan, the rose is also an emblem
of love?' she whispered, as we walked slowly hand in
hand towards the town, the lights of which were
sparkling in the distance.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Iola.'
</p>

<p>
'Alas!'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because the rose lives but for a day&mdash;and if it
should be so with love?'
</p>

<p>
'Why that thought, and why these doubts&mdash;my
love will live for ever, Iola!'
</p>

<p>
(<i>For ever</i>?  Alas! where were a heedless passion
and two bright eyes hurrying me?)
</p>

<p>
'It is indeed delightful to have one's life thus
entwined with another (and you will be always in
Rodosdchig, I hope?); to have a double existence and
double joy, as if we lived in the Rose Garden of Sadi.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah&mdash;but I fear your existence is so entwined
already: your husband, Iola?'
</p>

<p>
She uttered a faint cry of anger, and thus I found
my conjectures right.
</p>

<p>
'My husband!' she exclaimed; 'talk not of him!  He
bought me as he did his horse, in the common
market-place.  He never asked me to love him.  O that were
a condescension too much for a proud Turk!  I am
a Mohammedan now; but I was a Christian born,
and am by blood a Greek, and my dead ancestors, who
lie at Smyrna and at Scio, would raise their fleshless
hands against me, could they know me as I know
myself to-day.  My husband bought me from a
ruffian, reckless as himself.  I was bathed, perfumed,
and led to his arms.  Bismillah! speak no more of
my husband!'
</p>

<p>
These words removed every vestige of scruple in my
heart.  A purchased slave! could I ever view her
as a wedded wife?  But now she drew her feradjee
close about her, and fled from my side without a word
of to-morrow, or of meeting again; for we had
unconsciously approached too near one of the town-gates,
where, as she had previously mentioned, a <i>dumb</i> slave
awaited her.  Here I lost sight of her, having pledged
my word of honour neither to follow nor to make
inquiries after her.
</p>

<p>
My heart sank as she left me; and the idea of this
delicate and beautiful woman being bought and sold
in a market-place, and being now the wedded slave of
a sensual Moslem, made me writhe and ponder deeply,
as I walked along the dark and muddy streets of
Rodosdchig.  The town was now sunk in silence, and
not a sound was heard, save the occasional howling
of wild and wandering dogs&mdash;the faithful but
'unclean beasts,' of the ungrateful Koran.
</p>

<p>
'Love begetteth love,' so my heart was sorely
troubled.  I could no longer doubt that this beautiful
Oriental loved me.  Her dark but brilliant eyes were
full of it.
</p>

<p>
Her sighs but half suppressed as she had hung
upon my shoulder; her cheek alternately pale and
flushed, were also full of it.
</p>

<p>
Her tremulous voice&mdash;her conversation and manner&mdash;her
very silence spoke of it&mdash;this deep fount of
passion opened up within her ardent heart for the
<i>first</i> time, and yet&mdash;pardon me for the chilling close to
my sentence&mdash;she had been some years <i>married</i>.
</p>

<p>
For two evenings I went to the ruins, but she did
not come again.  I was well nigh my wit's end, and
more than once narrowly escaped a stab from a handjiar,
or a shot from a pistol, as I rambled about the
bazaars and bezestiens, running after every woman
whose figure resembled Iola's, and poking my nose
closer to their yashmacks than Oriental propriety
permits; so close, indeed, that I was once nearly
having my heels turned up by the ferashes of a mufti,
despite my red coat and claymore.
</p>

<p>
Restless, thoughtful, anxious and abstracted&mdash;haunted
by a pair of beautiful eyes that were the
object of my waking thoughts in the morning, the
last at night, and the source of many a lonely hour
of reverie between, I was deeply in love with her
before I knew the whole truth, or saw the full danger
of our position; and even when cold reason displayed
both, I was more charmed than startled by the
novelty of this new passion.
</p>

<p>
And she loved me, the possessor of those beautiful
eyes!
</p>

<p>
Oh, there was something delicious in the thought
that this attractive woman, so bright, so brilliant, so
happy in spirit&mdash;she who unconsciously attracted me
to her, as in a better sphere she would have attracted
all&mdash;even as the sun in his glory is said to absorb the
atoms in the air&mdash;should love me!
</p>

<p>
Who was she?  Where was she?
</p>

<p>
Oh, for Aladdin's lamp, or the ring of the Genii!
</p>

<p>
A thousand dazzling and daring schemes of elopement
suggested themselves to me, for Laura's loss
and desertion had made me reckless of consequences;
but first I had to discover Iola among the closely-veiled
hundreds of Kodosdchig; a task about as vain
as the proverbial one, of attempting to find a needle
in a haystack.

<h3>
CHAPTER XLI.
<br /><br />
A STRANGE TASK.
</h3>

<p>
Returning one evening, dispirited and provoked
after a second unsuccessful visit to the Ruined
Hermitage, on entering the castle of Rodosdchig, I was
informed by Callum that the Yuze Bashi had been
inquiring for me everywhere, urgently and angrily.
Surprised to hear this, I repaired at once to his
quarters, and was introduced without ceremony; for the
unfortunate captain of Bombardiers was considerably
perturbed, and in great tribulation.
</p>

<p>
I found him seated on a carpet, in a corner of an
apartment, the walls of which were, as usual, covered
with pious sentences from the Koran.  He was
smoking a narguillah, through a crystal vase of
rose-water, and the window, through which he usually
watched the sun dip behind the hills, was open, to
admit the sea-breeze, for he was flushed and feverish.
An urgent despatch had come from the Seraskier and
Kiaja Kiatibi, summoning him to appear without a
moment's delay at Constantinople, on peril alike of
his military button and his head.
</p>

<p>
'Beard of Ali!' he exclaimed, 'is not this alarming?'
</p>

<p>
'Rather,' said I, remembering that the first-named
official was generalissimo of the Sultan's forces, and
that the second was minister for the Home Department;
and now the memory of a thousand peculations,
local oppressions, extortions, and tyrannies
came appallingly before Hussein, who, in his
administration at Rodosdchig, had been about as
tenderhearted as a Madras collector.  Besides, he knew that
he had ever been savagely severe with his men; for
that obedience which is simple subordination in the
European soldier, degenerates into mere slavery in
the Turk.
</p>

<p>
Poor Hadjee Hussein Ebn al Ajuz felt his respected
head wag somewhat loosely on his shoulders; but
while he prepared to depart at once for Stamboul, in
his selfish alarm for himself, the actual interest of his
wife and household were nearly forgotten.
</p>

<p>
His wife; here was a devil of a dilemma!  What
was to be done?  The question would have puzzled
the seven wiseacres of the East, had they been with us.
</p>

<p>
'And now,' said Hussein, relinquishing his narguillah
with a sigh, and belting his sabre about his
portly person; 'I look to <i>you</i> for a great service.'
</p>

<p>
'If I can serve you in anything, command me.'
</p>

<p>
'I shall not be gone many days.'
</p>

<p>
'Take care, Hussein; I would bet a month's pay,
or a quarter's field allowance, against the chances of
your ever coming back again.'
</p>

<p>
'Bismillah! don't say so, pray&mdash;I <i>shall</i> come back!'
</p>

<p>
'And this service?' said I.
</p>

<p>
'Is to take charge of my wife in my absence.'
</p>

<p>
'I beg pardon&mdash;did I hear you aright? to take
charge of&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'My wife,' continued Hussein, grinding his teeth;
'there is none other here to whom I can apply.  The
Moolah Moustapha, curses on him! is&mdash;I know not
where; and there is no Turkish officer in the castle,
save myself.  You are a beyzadeh (gentleman's son)
as well as a soldier.  I can trust you.'
</p>

<p>
'But your wife, Yuze Bashi&mdash;'tis a perilous trust,
especially in Turkey.'
</p>

<p>
'I have no resource,' said he, stamping his feet
with rage; 'none&mdash;I must leave this in ten minutes,
and cannot apply to my soldiers, and still less to
yours, to act for me in this delicate matter.'
</p>

<p>
'Excuse my plainness&mdash;but I do not like the duty.'
</p>

<p>
'I like you the better for this sincerity, and trust
you the more.'
</p>

<p>
'But&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'But me no buts!  You are like Sadd Ebn Kais,
who said to the Prophet on his march to Tabuc, "Give
me leave to stay behind, and expose me not unto
temptation;" because, as the Koran hints, he dared
not trust himself among the black-eyed girls of
Greece.  Your scruples are just; but remember,
they who do good shall obtain good, even in this
world.'
</p>

<p>
'I have never seen the lady,' said I, doubtfully;
'is she beautiful?'
</p>

<p>
The Yuze Bashi knit his brows, for this was
approaching forbidden ground; but he answered,
</p>

<p>
'Beautiful as a Houri, and young&mdash;so young that I
might be her father; so you must watch over her
and guard her as if she was concealed by the seven
blessed doors of the Prophet Zacharias.'
</p>

<p>
'So I am to be the guardian of a Turkish harem&mdash;what
next?' thought I.
</p>

<p>
'You have still doubts,' said Hussein, with
increasing irritation.  'Listen to me; when I was in
the castle of Selyvria, my subaltern, afterwards the
Cole-agassi Mohammed Saïd, was suddenly ordered to
join the train of artillery then embarking for the
Crimea, and it was on peril of his head that he
loitered for a moment, after receiving the summons
of the Seraskier.  Here was just such a dilemma as
mine; but he came to me, saying,
</p>

<p>
'Hussein, you must be unto me as <i>my brother</i>; my
purse, my wife, and my household, I leave in your
safe keeping.'
</p>

<p>
'You have my word of honour,' said I.
</p>

<p>
'It is unnecessary,' said he, 'for I believe in
you.'  And so he sailed for the Euxine.
</p>

<p>
'For three months I had charge of his young and
pretty wife.  I never saw her; but my servants by
turns watched the house, allowing none to enter&mdash;none
at least but Ali Pasha, who paid me a hundred
piastres for every visit; so you see I was very strict,
and daily sent my grandfather, who was a decrepit
old man, to ask if she required anything.'
</p>

<p>
'And the subaltern Mohammed Saïd?'
</p>

<p>
'Came back no more.'
</p>

<p>
'How?'
</p>

<p>
'He died a major at the passage of the Alma.'
</p>

<p>
'And his wife?'
</p>

<p>
'When her jewels were sold, married Hussein Aga
(the steward of Ali Pasha), who paid me fifty piastres
each time he left his slippers at the door.  But you
are an Ingleez&mdash;I can trust you to guard my wife
better than I guarded the wife of Saïd&mdash;so watch her
well, though she is pure as the daughter of Imraun,
and gentle as the west wind, or the memory of a love
we have lost when young.'
</p>

<p>
In ten minutes afterwards this coolest, queerest,
and most cunning of all Yuze Bashis, had poised his
huge bulk on the saddle of a fleet horse.  With
many sore misgivings, and terrors of the Seraskier
and the Kiaja Kiatibi, he took his departure for
Stamboul, leaving me in full possession of the fortress,
and, more than all, of his wife, about whom, although
I had not seen her, I felt some curiosity as he had
acknowledged her to be young and beautiful as a
Houri.
</p>

<p>
The plot of my Greek adventures was thickening!
</p>

<p>
'In love with the wife of one Turk, and solemnly
requested, in a fatherly way of course, to look after
the rib of <i>another</i>!' says Jack Belton, in one of his
letters, which I received about this time by the hand
of a mounted Koord.  'An arduous duty for a
subaltern, Allan, but beware of meddling with such
matters in Turkey!  If the Horse Guards make light
of dangers risked in the field of Mars, they will make
lighter still of those encountered in the field of Venus.
Allons, my boy! on the llth February, Fort Alexander
at Sebastopol was blown up and entirely destroyed.
There is no word of our moving in that
direction yet, though it is said that a costermonger's
ass would not exchange duties with our poor fellows in
the trenches.  I send you a box of prime cheroots;
the last month's "Army List," the last Scotch
newspaper, "Punch," and the corkscrew you required so
much, and wishing you safe back again with your
pins under the mess mahogany, remain, ever yours,

CHAPTER XLII.
<br /><br />
TWO CHARMING EYES.
</h3>

<p>
If Hussein imagined that Callum Dhu and I were to
watch his premises, and to guard the bower of his
lady-love, even in the slender way that he watched
those of the Cole-agassi Mohammed Saïd, he was very
much mistaken; for, beyond an extra injunction to
the sentinel at the gate to admit no man into the
little fortress without my express permission I
troubled myself no more about the matter; but this order
would have proved no bar to an enterprising Turkish
lover, or an intriguing Turkish wife, as the
apartments of the Yuze Bashi had windows and a private
door, which opened into a beautiful rose-garden
without the walls; and the stockades, which once
formed a barrier in that direction had all been sold
long since by the avaricious Hussein for firewood.
</p>

<p>
The evening of the day after his departure was
drawing near when I bethought me of my Unknown
Beauty at the Ruined Hermitage, and before bending
my steps in that direction, I lingered on the beach
for a time, below the castle-wall, in the hope that she
might pass that way.
</p>

<p>
The town was hidden by the weather-beaten masses
of the old castle, the round towers of which had for
ages formed a landmark to the sea.  Reddened under
the western sun, the ocean seemed on fire towards its
verge, and the clouds were piled over each other, like
mountains of burnished brass, or gold and flame, but
ever crumbling, changing, and forming anew, as they
rolled along the horizon, in all the splendour of an
oriental sunset.  A gorgeous orange tint was spreading
over everything; the distant capes and headlands,
isles, and rocks, were all tinged with amber
and violet hue or fiery red; and mirrored in that
shining sea which blended into yellow and crimson
as its waves rolled away towards the marble island of
Marmora.
</p>

<p>
Among the rocks on which this strong old castle of
the Grecians stood, the dwarf oak, the flowering
arbutus, the broad-leaved bay, the fragrant myrtle,
the <i>spini Christi</i> of the gallant Crusaders, the fig, the
olive, the golden orange, and the luscious pomegranate,
with its brown and husky bulbs, were all growing
in luxuriance; while over all some giant
plane-trees&mdash;which, by a marvel, had escaped the cupidity
of Hussein, though their stems were seven feet
thick&mdash;spread their shady branches.  The castled
promontory was a place of groves, of flowers, and of
perfume.
</p>

<p>
Lingering there, and thinking, almost with a sigh,
that such a land was worthy of a better race, there
fell something at my feet.
</p>

<p>
It was three rose-buds&mdash;the faded three I had given
to my veiled fair one a few nights ago!  I started
and looked up, just as the white hand that had dropped
them was withdrawn from a casement in the old
castle-wall close by, and not ten feet from where I
was sitting, and where I had been musing for an
hour past with Strabo and Herodotus and their old
memories, conflicting in my mind, with the recollection
of her magnificent eyes, when I found them
beaming upon me!
</p>

<p>
She was still muffled in her yashmack and feradjee,
yet I knew her in a moment.
</p>

<p>
'Iola!' I exclaimed; 'you here?'
</p>

<p>
'Here, where I first saw you,' said she, smiling,
and waving a kiss towards me in the prettiest little
flirting way imaginable.
</p>

<p>
'What&mdash;are you then&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'The lady of whom you have such solemn charge.'
</p>

<p>
'The wife of the Yuze Bashi?'
</p>

<p>
'The wife of Hussein Ebn al Ajuz,' she added, with
a gleam in her black eyes.
</p>

<p>
'His prisoner, rather, poor Iola! what have you
to live for?'
</p>

<p>
'Those who love me&mdash;for them I live, and for them
only.  I am <i>your</i> prisoner at present, for Hussein has
gone to Stamboul with terror in every hair of his
beard.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, Iola, you are worthy of a brighter and a better
sphere than your husband can ever assign you.
There are some things I wish you could understand;
but the Mohammedan can form no conception of the
position assigned to your sex among the Franks of
the western world, where the influence of Christianity
and of chivalry have served to exalt and purify the
character of woman.'
</p>

<p>
'I <i>do</i> know all this,' she answered, impetuously,
'for I am come of Albanian blood, and love the
Christians, though they bow their heads and bend their
knees before gilded idols and painted pictures; for
among our mountains the Mussulmen cling to the
memory of their Christian fathers, and, on certain
days, say a prayer at the old stone crosses that mark
where they lie.  Moreover, I have been taught that it
was the place assigned to Mary, the first Christian
woman, that gave a nobility and purity to the women
of Frangistan.  I know this, for I am a Greek by
birth, though a Mohammedan by faith; and, oh,
blessed be the Moolah Moustapha, he who revealed
unto me the divine teachings of the Koran.  Yet,'
she added, with tears, and in a tremulous voice,
'I can remember my dear, dear mother, teaching
me to kiss the little cross of the Christian's triple
God!'
</p>

<p>
I winced a little at this peculiar phrase.
</p>

<p>
'Your mother&mdash;you remember her, then?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, yes&mdash;yes! tall, beautiful, pale, and sad!' she
added, throwing her white hands and dark eyes
upwards; 'her blood&mdash;her hot blood&mdash;came over me as
she died!'
</p>

<p>
'Iola! her blood&mdash;then she was killed?'
</p>

<p>
'Murdered&mdash;she was barbarously murdered before
my eyes&mdash;for she was a Greek, and the wife of the
gallant Demetrius Vidimo.'
</p>

<p>
'Good heavens&mdash;what is this you tell me?'
</p>

<p>
'The truth,' she added, weeping; 'the terrible
truth&mdash;you have heard of my father, then?'
</p>

<p>
'And you are&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Iola Vidimo.'
</p>

<p>
'The sister of Constantine&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Mohammed! how know you that?  I had a
brother&mdash;a dear little brother, so named.  Can you
tell me aught of him?  Speak&mdash;speak&mdash;have you lost
your tongue?'
</p>

<p>
I had much to tell her, but how was I to fashion
the tidings that her brother had been shot in the
presence of her husband; and that he&mdash;Hussein&mdash;was
one of those brutal soldiers who, after a vain
contention for the person of her mother, had so
barbarously pistolled her!
</p>

<p>
'Do you know this coral cross, Iola?'
</p>

<p>
She uttered a cry.
</p>

<p>
'It was my beloved mother's, and on that awful
day at Acre, sixteen years ago, she tied it round the
neck of my boy-brother, when we were separated.
Tell me about Constantine&mdash;does he live?'
</p>

<p>
'It is a long story, Iola, and one that cannot
be related here; but you forget yourself&mdash;you are
excited&mdash;your voice may be overheard, and I
may be seen.  Where can we meet&mdash;at&mdash;the Hermitage?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'Where?'
</p>

<p>
'Here.'
</p>

<p>
'Here?'
</p>

<p>
'In these apartments.'
</p>

<p>
'If I am discovered?' I urged, with a heart that
vibrated with strange emotions.
</p>

<p>
'Where so safe as within a pistol-shot of your own
soldiers?'
</p>

<p>
'True&mdash;but your honour, Iola?'
</p>

<p>
'Is in my own keeping&mdash;do you hesitate?' she
added, with a flash in her magnificent eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Dearest Iola, I will be here in an hour after
sunset&mdash;but how to reach the window?'
</p>

<p>
'Leave that to me.'
</p>

<p>
'Hush!'
</p>

<p>
'Some one comes,' she exclaimed, and shut the
latticed-window, as I hurried away in a tumult of
thought.
</p>

<p>
The interruption proceeded only from a wandering
Arab, who was drunk with raki, and chaunted aloud
the glories of the starlight, which, in his hot and
sultry clime, is loved better than the sunshine.
</p>

<p>
'Leili&mdash;Leili!  O night&mdash;night!' was the burden of
his monotonous and intrusive ditty, for which I felt
a decided inclination to punch his head.
</p>

<p>
I was aware that in forming this appointment with
Iola I was making a sad breach in the trust Hussein
had been compelled to repose in me; but what the
deuce was I to do?  An oriental woman is not to be
trifled with; for love and hate are strong and sudden
passions under an eastern sun; and while heartily
despising and wholly disliking Hussein on one hand,
I felt myself dazzled and fascinated by his imprisoned
odalisque on the other.  Then I remembered his cool
admissions of the hundred piastres of Ali Pasha, and
the fifty piastres of Hussein Aga, the steward, and
my scruples melted away.
</p>

<p>
I lighted one of Jack Belton's 'prime cheroots,' and
sat down to think over the matter, and viewed it
through the mellowing medium of a glass of
brandy-and-water.  I resolved to finish my flirtation with
all propriety and speed; looked at my watch, and
longed exceedingly for the dark hour, which, in that
climate, follows the sinking of the sun.
</p>

<p>
Alas! how weak are the best resolutions of the
human heart, when opposed to the magic influence of
<i>two charming eyes</i>!

<h3>
CHAPTER XLIII.
<br /><br />
I SCALE THE WINDOW.
</h3>

<p>
When remembering Laura Everingham and the pleasant
days of other times, I sighed with mingled regret
and bitterness.  Was it the old love for her that
could not be crushed, or the new love for my
beautiful Oriental that I could but imperfectly
comprehend, and which had so much of stirring novelty and
imminent danger among its chief allurements?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps I found myself a little in that dilemma
which&mdash;-I trust all fair ladies will pardon the
avowal&mdash;is not uncommon among men&mdash;<i>loving two women at
once</i>&mdash;'a way we often have in the army,' as Belton
would say.
</p>

<p>
The new passion which had seized me was certainly
strengthened by a sentiment of pique at Laura (oh,
Laura, I could love you still!); yet this passion,
improper, unwarrantable, name it as you will, friend
reader, for this beautiful and too facile Moslem,
filled all my heart and fired my imagination with a
thousand romantic fancies.  I saw all her danger and
my own.  One moment I lamented the evil chance
which had sent me on this solitary duty, and cast me
in her path; and the next, I looked at my watch,
impatient of the lagging sunset.
</p>

<p>
Thus did love fire, and reason cool me by turns.
</p>

<p>
'I know,' says a recent writer, 'that five feet eight
inches of female flesh and blood, when accompanied
by a pale complexion, black eyes, and raven hair,
is synonymous with strong passions and an unfortunate
destiny.'  And most unfortunate was your destiny, poor Iola!
</p>

<p>
Ah, those beautiful eyes!  How sadly they put
all one's wits and self-possession to flight&mdash;by their
arrows routing horse, foot, and artillery.
</p>

<p>
I regarded her as a caged bird longing for freedom.
I could not conceive it possible that the wife of a
Turk&mdash;especially such a devilish and unmitigated
Turk as the fat Yuze Bashi Hussein&mdash;should be
otherwise than most unhappy; for the Mohammedan
deems women the mere appendage of a household&mdash;a
necessary comfort among others; a handsome wife,
a cup of coffee, and a well-filled chiboque, are the
mainsprings of life in the eyes of a true
Believer&mdash;unless we add a hot bath and a savoury kabob.
</p>

<p>
With these reflections, an hour after sunset, I found
myself in the dewy twilight, under her window, and
among those richly-wooded rocks on which the sea
of Marmora was rolling in ripples of violet, blue,
and gold.
</p>

<p>
It was one of those brilliant nights when all the
constellations are visible, and the poor Mohammedan
believes that all the imps of earth are climbing to
Heaven, to pry into the actions and overhear the
conversation of the blessed, who occasionally pelt
and slay them with the falling stars.
</p>

<p>
I waited for a little time, and then her lattice
slowly&mdash;I thought reluctantly&mdash;unclosed; and two
white hands were clapped gently together.
</p>

<p>
I replied to the signal; the stem of a date-tree and
the tough branches of a wild vine enabled me to reach
the window with ease, and in a moment I found
myself within the sanctum sanctorum of a Mohammedan
house&mdash;the anderun, or female apartments of the Yuze
Bashi Hussein.
</p>

<p>
Iola was trembling; she drew her yashmack closely
about her face, and hastened to shut the casement.
Her eyes were full of tears, and that she had been
seized by some unusual qualm, or terror of these
proceedings, was but too apparent.  This was
unpleasant, as it gave me the sensation of being
somewhat of a conspirator, at least.
</p>

<p>
The successful peculations of Hussein had enabled
him to make the apartments of his Greek wife
magnificent.  The roof was all of blue velvet, painted
with the figures of birds and flowers.  The walls
were hung with silk, in alternate broad red and
white stripes, on which shone gilded sentences from
the Koran.  An exquisite Persian carpet covered the
floor, on which were a profusion of velvet and
embroidered cushions of the softest and lightest down
arranged in the form of couches; and there were two
little stools bearing coffee-trays and chiboques.  The
lower end of the apartment, which was divided in
two by festooned curtains of the finest muslin, was
hung with leopard-skins, and trophies of Turkish
and Arabian arms of the keenest steel&mdash;sabres, handjiars,
carbines, pistols, lances, matchlocks, and ancient
horsetailed standards, arranged, in the form of stars,
round Tartar shields of brown bull-hide, all glittering
with knobs of burnished brass.  The perfume of
rich pastiles and wood of aloes, burning in tripods of
bronze, and the fragrance of six tall candelabra full
of fresh flowers, pervaded the apartment, which was
lit by two large lamps of fine oil, the smoke of which
was consumed by cream-coloured globes, that diffused
a warm and voluptuous light.
</p>

<p>
To complete the picture of this remarkable apartment,
let me remind the reader of Iola, who, shrinking
a little from me, stood in the centre of it, with
irresolution and timidity in her air and eyes.
</p>

<p>
She wore the hideous feradjee of the Turkish
women, which enveloped her whole form, permitting
little of its oriental symmetry to be seen; yet from
amid its ample folds I could discern her hands, which
were gloveless, and her little feet, which had embroidered
slippers, and the faultless form and delicacy of
which there were no stockings to conceal.
</p>

<p>
Her black and brilliant eyes, expressive, languishing,
and inquiring, arch and smiling by turns, were
now bent on me, timidly and imploringly, under
their long lashes and dark eyebrows, which were
well arched, defined, and full of character&mdash;a charming
thing in every girl.  Through the thin yashmack,
or veil of fine muslin, which concealed the lower
part of her face, after that abominable fashion which
the restless jealousy of their male tyrants imposes on
the women of the East, I could discern that her
features were beautiful.  Her turban was of muslin,
sprigged with gold; she had an ivory pomander ball
of attar-gul in one hand; a finely-embroidered
handkerchief and a sandal-wood rosary from Mecca in
the other.
</p>

<p>
The respect with which she was treated was
puzzling and confusing to her, as a Turkish woman;
for in her country the fair sex are kept in a state of
subjugation so strict, that a sister dare not sit in her
younger brother's presence without first obtaining
permission.
</p>

<p>
I attempted to take her hands, but she withdrew
them, and crossed them on her bosom.
</p>

<p>
'Iola,' said I, tenderly; 'have you ceased to love me?'
</p>

<p>
'I know not,' she replied, sadly; 'for, as the Koran
says, it belongeth to Allah alone to fathom the human
heart&mdash;and I cannot fathom mine.'
</p>

<p>
'You are doubtful of your own emotions.'
</p>

<p>
'I am sad&mdash;very sad&mdash;having much reason to be so.'
</p>

<p>
'Allow me to remove this veil, for Heaven's sake,
dear Iola!' I continued, trembling with the earnestness
of my own sentiments; 'do not repel me.'
</p>

<p>
She was passive, and I hastened to remove both the
feradjee and the horrid yashmack; and then her fine
figure appeared in a close velvet jacket, sleeved only
to the elbow, cut low at the neck and open at the
bosom; and her hair was gathered about her beautiful
head in massive braids, like perfumed and sable
silk.  She trembled and blushed excessively, for, by
the Mohammedan law, aged women who are past the
time of marriage <i>alone</i> may lay this veil aside.
</p>

<p>
Her white neck and arms were encircled by strings
of Turkish rose pearls, made from the leaves of
freshly-culled roses, bruised to a paste, and dried and
rolled in oil of roses and musk, and which, being
thus beautifully polished and pleasantly perfumed,
are favourite ornaments in the East.
</p>

<p>
She had all that combination of spiritual and
voluptuous loveliness which her Grecian sires of
old worshipped in the olive-groves of Paphos, and in
the temples of Cyprus and Cytheria, when the power
of Juno's rival was supreme.
</p>

<p>
I drew her gently towards me, but still she averted
her timid and downcast face.
</p>

<p>
'Iola&mdash;why this change?' I asked, in a pettish
tone; 'have you ceased to love me now?'
</p>

<p>
'I have not ceased to love you,' she answered,
while trembling painfully; 'at first you merely struck
my fancy, when passing daily in the castle-yard,
where you seemed so different in air, so free in step
and bearing, from the slow, heavy-headed, and
crook-legged soldiers of Hussein; but now you&mdash;you&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What?'
</p>

<p>
'Have keenly touched my heart.  Alas!' she
continued, weeping; '<i>now</i> I am more a slave than ever
the piastres of Hussein, or the promise I gave him,
before the Kadi, made me!'
</p>

<p>
'Be wary, Iola&mdash;remember that your servants may
hear us, and our position is full of danger.'
</p>

<p>
'There is no danger,' she replied, bitterly; 'they
are all dumb&mdash;voiceless as marble statues.'
</p>

<p>
'Dumb?'
</p>

<p>
'Mutes&mdash;tongueless&mdash;and two are deaf, or rendered so.'
</p>

<p>
'Horrible!  For what reason?'
</p>

<p>
'To prevent their being indiscreet.'
</p>

<p>
'A wise precaution.'
</p>

<p>
'So my husband thinks&mdash;but a cruel one.'
</p>

<p>
After a pause, she added, 'Would to Allah that he
had left me in the care of his friend, the Moolah
Moustapha!'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Can you ask me?  The Moolah is said to know&mdash;like
Solymon Ebn Daood&mdash;the language of the
birds; and every kind of secret knowledge; and thus
he had watched over the wanderings of my heart.'
</p>

<p>
'Nay, dearest Iola, these scruples and coquettish
regrets come somewhat late&mdash;and one kiss&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Bismillah!  In the name of the most Merciful,
touch me not!' she exclaimed, with a coy alarm that
was rather chilling; but she was too late: my kiss
was on her pouting lip, and she did not repulse
me&mdash;for she felt assured, by the night and the silence
around us, that no ear was there to overhear us, and
no mortal eye but mine to see her unveiled beauty.
</p>

<p>
Here endeth the first lesson.

<h3>
CHAPTER XLIV.
<br /><br />
TEMPTATION AND FOLLY.
</h3>

<p>
Never while life remains shall I forget the hours of
delight I passed with Iola.
</p>

<p>
I know that it was wrong&mdash;exceedingly wrong&mdash;and
blamable in me to have yielded to the tempting
peril of engaging in this flirtation&mdash;to give my regard
for Iola its mildest term&mdash;but what could I do?
And having once yielded to the allurement, and
encouraged her in it, how could I fly or avoid
her?
</p>

<p>
I met her no more at the Ruined Hermitage, or at
the green City of the Silent, for such interviews were
full of peril; but I met her again and again, in the
seclusion of her own apartments, into which not
even the tongueless and mutilated slaves of Hussein
could penetrate without a signal being given and
permission accorded from within.  Thus we had an
interview every evening, and had much delightful
conversation, and many an hour of mute reverie.
</p>

<p>
How strange and alluring were those long, deep,
and dangerous reveries, which were full of beatings
of the heart, and tender meanings which the pen
cannot depict, and no written language can convey!
</p>

<p>
My word plighted to the absent Hussein&mdash;my
honour, and more than all, her honour&mdash;yea, her very
life, were in peril, yet I trifled with both, like the
heedless, reckless, and it may be, selfish boy I was!
</p>

<p>
Poor Iola!
</p>

<p>
I related the story of her brother's desertion,
recapture, trial, and the death he suffered so
courageously in our presence at Heraclea.  I mentioned the
two little incidents which brought me in personal
contact with him; first in the public khan, and
secondly at the last terrible scene in the valley of the
mosque, where from his dead hand I took the little
coral cross, which by a strange course of events I
was now enabled to suspend upon the bosom of his
sister; and as I did so, I thought of all that
high-spirited and noble Albanian soldier would have felt
had he seen that sister, now a Mahommedan, (the
wife of one of those barbarous Osmanli who pistolled
his stately mother at Acre,) and hanging in all her
loveliness, dissolved in tears and grief upon the
bosom of a stranger&mdash;a soldier of Frangistan!
</p>

<p>
I deemed it well for Hussein, well for Iola, and
particularly fortunate for myself, that the fiery young
lieutenant of Albanians was sleeping in his quiet
grave, where the slaves of the Mir Alai Saïd had laid
him.
</p>

<p>
Tempered by politeness, and by that respect and
deference to a female which have come down to us
from the days of the Crusaders and the Cavaliers, the
manner of a European lover is so different from the
bearing of an Oriental one, that there can be little
wonder if the heart of a Mahommedan woman is
easily won by the stiff-hatted, tight-coated, and
long-trousered denizen of that ample and mysterious
district known to her only as Frangistan.  In the matter
of love and wedlock, the Turkish woman has as little
idea of freedom as the Turk has of the arguments
advanced by S. Bufford, gent.&mdash;a certain learned
pundit, who, in the reign of King William III., wrote
an Essay 'against persons marrying <i>without their own
consent</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, that I had the right to love you, as I have the
right to hate the Yuze Bashi Hussein!' said Iola,
after one of her long silences.  'Oh the odious!
May the heel of my slipper be ever on his
mouth&mdash;and yet&mdash;and yet he is my husband!'
</p>

<p>
'I wince always at that word in your pretty mouth,
Iola!'
</p>

<p>
'In loving you, I cease to love him&mdash;-if indeed I
ever loved him.  Allah did not create woman with
two hearts&mdash;with one under each breast, as the
Moolah Moustapha affirms.'
</p>

<p>
'But our love is full of sadness as well as peril,
Iola&mdash;for a day is coming when I must leave you.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, leave me not!' she exclaimed, passionately.
'Must my love be sacrificed to this coarse and
untutored Osmanli?  The day after you leave me I shall
have ceased to live.'
</p>

<p>
'Leave you I must, Iola.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?&mdash;when?'
</p>

<p>
'When ordered&mdash;for I, too, have Yuze Bashis and
Mir Alais and Pashas who command me.'
</p>

<p>
'By the love with which you have inspired me!'
she said in a piercing whisper, with her black eyes
flashing in brilliance through their tears; 'I conjure
you to take me with you, for I cannot live without
you, and without you I must die!'
</p>

<p>
With these words she threw herself upon my
breast, heedless of everything.
</p>

<p>
'I will take you with me, Iola, if I can&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Nay you must&mdash;you shall!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;yes, at all hazards.'
</p>

<p>
'Why should I die so young?'
</p>

<p>
'You will go with me&mdash;I promise you,' I replied,
heedless of the future; and then she gave me a smile
of confiding fondness that would have melted the
heart of our old friend Bluebeard.
</p>

<p>
'My husband will be here anon, and his jealousy&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;fear him not, Iola; jealousy gives a relish
to love&mdash;just as musk does to sherbet, or pepper to a
kabob,' said I, gaily.
</p>

<p>
'But alas,' said she, with a shudder, 'the jealousy
of a Turk is terrible!  Could I teach Hussein that
love and respect&mdash;or love and affection are two
distinct sentiments?'
</p>

<p>
'Give me but the love, Iola, and bestow the
affection on whom you please.'
</p>

<p>
'Allah!' she exclaimed, with a shudder, and a
gleam of terror in her expressive eyes, as she shrunk
from my arm; 'what if <i>you</i> should be Hussein?'
</p>

<p>
'I Hussein&mdash;I the Yuze Bashi?' I asked, in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;O Mahmoud! there is a strange sparkle in
your eye.'
</p>

<p>
'How could such a thing be?' I asked, smiling at
her simplicity.
</p>

<p>
'Genii give men the power to assume the forms,
faces, and voices of others for a time,' she replied, a
little reassured; 'have you never heard so?'
</p>

<p>
'Never.'
</p>

<p>
'How strange!  Have you not heard of the wise
Sultan Solymon, and his magic ring&mdash;of the evil Geni
Sakhur, and how they changed forms and faces for
forty days?'
</p>

<p>
'Never, on my honour.'
</p>

<p>
'Listen, and I will tell you,' said she, clasping her
white hands upon my left shoulder, and reclining her
brow upon my cheek, while her speaking eyes were
lifted up to mine, as we reclined among the soft and
silky cushions; 'listen, and I will tell you a story&mdash;oh,
a very wonderful story&mdash;of things that happened
long long ago,' she continued, while her fine eyes
diluted and filled with light; 'long before Othmon
the Bonebreaker sat on the Sultan's throne, and long
before Palæologus perished beneath the cimitars of
the Janissaries&mdash;but kiss me once again before I
begin.'
</p>

<p>
The request was soon granted, and in her pretty
little prattling way, Lola told me the following tale
of wonder and magic.

CHAPTER XLV
<br /><br />
STORY OF THE WISE KING AND THE WICKED GENI.
</h3>

<p>
'Once upon a time there was a king of Sidon, who
had a daughter, and in beauty she surpassed all the
maids of Asia.  You must know that this was in the
days when all the kingdom of Frangistan was hidden
in darkness, and when none dwelt there but little
men who lived on human flesh, whose faces were in
their stomachs, who had but one leg, with which they
made prodigious leaps in the dark from the summit of
one hill to the summit of another, and when there
dwelt in Assyria a mighty Sultan, named Solymon
Ebn Daood, who ruled all the land that lies between
the Euphrates on the east and the Mediterranean on
the west, and from Mount Taurus on the north to
Arabia on the south.
</p>

<p>
'He was a great and wondrous king; for after he
slew&mdash;as an offering unto heaven&mdash;those thousand
winged horses which came to him out of the sea near
Damascus, Allah gave him power over the wind, by
which he could cause it to blow at his will, over
the hot deserts of Arabia, over Suristan, the Land of
Roses, and over his own blessed realm.  The Koran
tells us, that on this wind, he could transport his
mighty throne&mdash;the star and work of the Genii&mdash;from
Damascus unto the hot shores of the Indian sea, in a
single day; and unto him were subjected all the
winged Genii; all the blue devils who dive for
pearls in the sea of Kolzom, and those who build
cities of gold and silver, and palaces of precious
stones.
</p>

<p>
'Having gone to war with the king of Sidon, whose
territories he had desolated by a cold north wind, he
resolved to besiege the city, and ordered his magic
carpet to be spread without the gates of Mecca, and
it reached therefrom half-way to Jidda on the
seashore.  This carpet was a mighty piece of green silk
fabricated by the Genii, who did all that he
commanded them to do, as we are told in the 22nd Chapter
of the Holy Koran.  On this carpet stood the throne
whereon he was seated, and around it were all his
army, horse and foot, bowmen and spearmen, slingers
and swordsmen, marshalled by Asaf the vizier.
</p>

<p>
'The moment they were all in order, he commanded
them, to the number of a hundred thousand, to keep
steady in their ranks, and avoid the <i>edge</i> of the carpet;
then he placed his magic signet ring to his lips, and
lo!  There came a wind out of the eastern sky which
lifted up the carpet, with the throne, the troops, and
all that were thereon, and bore it through the air so
swiftly that like the shadow of a cloud, they traversed
all the blue vault of heaven, above Khaibar, where
the well of bitter water flows; over the mountains
that look down on Tabuc; over Arabia the Rocky;
over the domes of Jerusalem, and the dark waves of
the Dead Sea, and over Acre, until they alighted on
the sea shore of Phoenicia, near the city of Sidon,
which stands on a plain that extends two miles inward
from the ocean; and this was but the journey of half
a day to Solymon and his air-borne host.
</p>

<p>
'In great terror, the king of Sidon, when he saw
this vast cloud darkening all the sky above the city,
shut up his daughter Jerada, who had black hair that
hung down to her knees, and who had eyes that were
larger than her mouth; he placed her in a great
round tower, which stands upon a mountain near the
sea, and was built for him by the Geni Sakhur, who
was his chief friend.  But Solymon assaulted the
city, sacked and destroyed its manufactories of linen
and fine purple dyes, its schools of commerce and
astronomy.  He slew the king, while Asaf stormed the
tower upon the mountain, and capturing the beautiful
Jerada, brought her safely to Mecca before nightfall,
and before the cry for evening prayer had rung
from the minarets of the temple; and with her were
his throne, his soldiers, and all the plunder of the
Phoenician capital covering the magic carpet&mdash;and
all this was but the task of one day.
</p>

<p>
'But with all his power, this mighty Sultan now
became the slave of his slave, and the worshipper of
his bondswoman; for Jerada was beautiful as a houri
of Paradise.  Her figure was tall and full of majesty
and grace.  Her beauty was like her bearing, noble
as became the daughter of a king.  Her voice was
sweetly modulated, and of all his three hundred and
ten wives, not one could wile or soothe the soul of
Solymon like Jerada, when her snowy arms were
thrown around the harp, and she sang the songs of
Palestine.  Veiled by long black lashes, her eyes
were violet coloured, and of a deep, strange, and
mournful tint and expression&mdash;as she never forgot
that she was the daughter of Sidon's fallen king.
Her skin was white as the foam on the sea; her
hands and arms were exquisite; her manner soft and
polished; her spirit gentle; her intelligence quick;
her wit brilliant; and as his own unfathomable soul,
the great lord of all Assyria loved her.
</p>

<p>
'But in her secret heart, Jerada never ceased to
lament the fall of Sidon and her father's fate; and a
thousand times did Solymon surprise her in her
chamber, weeping bitterly.  Then his heart smote
him for the wrong he had done to one so fair, and he
desired the Genii to fashion an image of the slaughtered
king, and to mould it of wax, painted like life;
to clothe it in fine robes of Tyrian purple, and to set
upon its head the captured crown of Sidon.  This
image was placed in the chamber of Jerada, where
she and her maidens wept at its feet and worshipped
it morning and evening for the term of <i>forty</i> days;
but, on Asaf the vizier discovering this wicked
practice, he hastened in terror to Solymon and said,
</p>

<p>
'"Dost thou permit this foul idolatry?  If so, the
curse that fell on Ad will fall on thee, and this
worship of a waxen image must not be permitted in the
palace."
</p>

<p>
'When Solymon heard these words, he drew his
cimitar, and by one blow destroyed the work of the
Genii, and it vanished with a whistling sound.  He
chastised the beautiful Jerada by shutting her up in a
tower, on the door of which he placed his magic seal;
and then he went out into a wild and desert place,
where he wept over the evils that had followed the
fall of Sidon, and made supplications to Allah, crying
aloud, as the blessed Koran tells us,
</p>

<p>
'"Oh forgive me, and accord unto me a kingdom
which may not be obtained by any one after me, for
thou art the giver of thrones."[*]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
[*] See "Koran," xxxviii.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'But Allah resolved to chastise his negligence, and
it happened thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
It was the custom of this great sultan, when he
bathed or perfumed himself, to intrust his magic ring
or signet, on the possession of which depended all
his power and his kingdom, to one of his fairest
favourites; and one day, when retiring to the bath, he
placed it on the finger of Jerada, for with all his wisdom
the wisest man&mdash;yea, even Solymon&mdash;may be but a
fool before a beautiful woman.  Jerada, as she gazed
upon the ring, thought of her aged sire and fallen
Sidon&mdash;of his nameless grave and her fallen fortune,
and uttered a wish for "vengeance."
</p>

<p>
At that moment there was a tremulous motion in
the air, and the Geni Sakhur, the friend of her
father&mdash;the spirit who had built the great tower
which yet stands upon the mountain over against
Sidon, appeared before her <i>in the likeness of Solymon</i>,
and received from her the wonderful ring.  Then
the eyes of the Geni sparkled with triumph; he
breathed upon it, and lo! when the Sultan came from
the bath, he was an old and withered man, so changed
in aspect that none knew him; and then, mocked by
the courtiers, threatened by Asaf the vizier, hooted
by the pages and beaten by the guards, he was driven
from the palace gates, and forced to wander in the
desert, eating dates, berries, and wild fruits for the
space of <i>forty</i> days, returning ever and anon to beg
alms at the gates of Mecca, and at the porticos of his
own palace.
</p>

<p>
'Here he saw the Geni Sakhur, on the terraces and
in the gardens, clad in his royal garments, wearing
his likeness and having his voice, toying with the
lovely Jerada and the most beautiful of the ladies,
who crowded his magnificent household, and the
pious soul of this king&mdash;the mightiest that ever
swayed the sceptre of Assyria&mdash;swelled with futile
rage, for his ring was on Sakhur's finger, and he was
powerless as the meanest slave.
</p>

<p>
'Moreover, this evil Geni, by the power of which
he became possessed, governed the whole kingdom,
and while seated on its throne, made such startling
alterations in the laws, that Solyman, when he heard
them proclaimed by sound of trumpet and timbrel at
the brazen gates of Mecca, rent his garments and
wept, while the astonished Asaf threw dust upon his
head and beard in grief and wonder.
</p>

<p>
'At length <i>the forty days</i>, the exact period during
which the waxen image had been worshipped under
Solymon's roof, were expired; and then the devil
Sakhur, with a yell of laughter, sprang from the
throne on which he had been seated, with Jerada
by his side, and to the terror of the faithful Vizier
Asaf, and of all the courtiers, spread out his dusky
wings, and ascending straight into the air, flew away
with a speed that made him cleave the sky like a
bird; and as he winged his way to the home of the
Genii in the mountains of Kaf, he flung the magic
ring of Solymon into the sea of Galilee.
</p>

<p>
'As it cleft the deep blue waters, its glittering stones
and shining gold caught the eye of a large and silvery
fish, which immediately swallowed it; but soon
thereafter the fish began to writhe in great agony,
and was cast by the ebbing tide upon the yellow sands
near the then ruined and desolate city of Sidon.
</p>

<p>
'It happened that the Sultan Solymon, in form and
face an old man, bent with years and clad in tattered
garments, was wandering in hunger and destitution,
along the sands, eating shell-fish, when he espied this
large and silvery tenant of the deep, writhing on the
shore; he straightway killed it by a stone, and
making a fire of the wood called markh, which if
rubbed together will burn, be it ever so green, he
prepared to cook it, and lo! from its belly there
dropped the golden ring&mdash;the magic signet by which
the power of all Assyria was held&mdash;and with a prayer
of joy he placed it on his finger!
</p>

<p>
'In a moment he recovered his stately stature, his
manly beauty, his youthful face and curling beard;
and by uttering a wish, found himself in the hall of
his palace at Mecca, where he gave thanks unto Allah,
and proceeded at once to punish Jerada and the evil
Geni Sakhur.  The beautiful daughter of Sidon he
enclosed in a flinty rock on Mount Horeb, and there,
by a touch of his ring, sealed her up for ever.  The
Geni, by a whispered wish, he dragged shrieking
through the air from the far and snowy recesses of
Kaf.  Then tying a huge stone to his neck, he flung
him headlong into the lake of Tiberias in Galilee,
near which stands a town built by Herod; but the
Geni instantly changed his form, and arose from the
lake in the form of a small worm, which crept
towards Solymon, intent on revenge.
</p>

<p>
'Now, as we all know, it would take a small worm
a great many years to creep from the Lake of Tiberias
to Jerusalem, where the Sultan Solymon was then
finishing the great temple which was to stand there
for ever in lieu of the tabernacle of Moosa.  He
employed a million of Genii to complete the work, and
they toiled at it day and night, and over every Genii
was a warden, who made his secret mark upon their
work, and these spirits had secret signs and words by
which they knew each other&mdash;the signs and words
that were written on the seal of Solymon.  But this
mighty sultan perceiving that he was becoming aged,
and that his end was drawing nigh, prayed to Allah,
that, when he died, his death might be concealed from
the Genii, who, if they discovered it, would all fly
back to Kaf, and leave unfinished that gorgeous
temple, which was yet to be the wonder of the world.
</p>

<p>
'And kind Allah ordained it should be thus.
</p>

<p>
'When Solymon died&mdash;for who among us would live
for ever?&mdash;his spirit passed away as he stood at
prayer, leaning on his long staff of plane-tree&mdash;the
wood of the ark&mdash;and this staff supported his dead
body erect and fresh, and comely as when in life,
and as if he was still overseeing the work, for a year
and a day, until the Genii were placing the last
golden pomegranate on the shining summit of the
temple, in the centre of which shone <i>a vast eye</i> that
seemed to be behold everything; and all this while,
the impatient worm was still creeping towards the
dead Sultan.
</p>

<p>
'The worm reached the staff and gnawed it through;
then on the very instant the temple was completed in
all its parts, the body of the Sultan fell heavily to the
ground; his golden crown rang on the marble pavement;
and now, with a yell of rage, the overtasked
Genii found that they had been deluded, and that
their master had been dead for a year and a day!
</p>

<p>
'Thus it is that the twenty-fourth chapter of the
Koran saith these words:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'"When we decreed that Solymon should die,
nothing revealed his death unto them except the
<i>creeping thing</i> of the earth, which gnawed his staff, and
then his body fell down."
</p>

<p>
'Such was the story of the Wise King and the
Wicked Geni.'
</p>

<p class="t3">
&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'And Jerada,' said I, laughing, 'did she still
remain sealed up in the rock, or did the death of Solymon
dissolve the spell?'
</p>

<p>
'Jerada wept and prayed sorely, for she had not
deceived Solymon; but had been herself deceived by
the wicked Geni Sakhur, who, as a traitor and falsifier,
was worthy of the most severe death, the just could
inflict&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Right, O Allah!' exclaimed a hoarse fierce voice
behind us; 'right, wretch, and you have named your
own sentence!'
</p>

<p>
A low cry of terror left the white lips of Iola, and
springing to my feet, I found myself confronted by
the two flaming eyes, the levelled pistols, and the
portly person of the furious Yuze Bashi, Hussein Ebn
al Ajuz!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap46"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XLVI.
<br /><br />
HUSSEIN'S WRATH.
</h3>

<p>
While listening to this old Arabian legend, which
fell so prettily from the lisping tongue of Iola, I never
thought of Hussein, who, having transacted with the
Seraskier his business, which merely concerned the
shipment of certain guns and shot for Varna, was
then galloping along the paved road to Rodosdchig.
</p>

<p>
Intent upon the dark and tender eyes, the white
neck, and soft tresses of Iola, I did not hear the ruffle
beaten on the brass drum of the Main-guard as he
cantered into the court; nor did I hear the tramp of
his horse or his heavy foot-fall on the old Greek
marble stair, or in the anteroom; nor did I remember
in any way that a being so ungainly and so decidedly
unwelcome existed in the world, until the muslin
hangings were fiercely rent asunder, and he stood
before us, his countenance livid with just rage, his
dark eyes gleaming like two live coals, and his long
brass-barrelled Turkish pistols levelled at us, one in
each hand.
</p>

<p>
I had no weapon but my sword, which I immediately
unsheathed, while instinctively placing myself
between him and the mute and terror-stricken Iola,
who sank grovelling before him, bowing her
beautiful head to the carpet, and murmuring only&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Mercy! mercy! vai! vai! woe&mdash;woe!'
</p>

<p>
Alarm for her, and shame for myself, deprived me
of utterance.  I could only interpose the long,
glittering blade of the Highland claymore between us,
and gaze on Hussein's angry front, debating whether
or not I should slash him across the fingers, lest he
might shoot one or both of us; and I remembered
poor Callum Dhu and his thirty comrades, who would
be at the mercy of Hussein's hundred Bombardiers,
and might, moreover, be exposed to the fury of the
populace, from whom not even the Greek Archbishop
of Rodosdchig could protect them.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, face of brass and heart of steel! what do I
see?' he exclaimed.  Then uttering that expression
of grief which is so frequently in the mouths of
Mohammedans, he rent his white beard, and cried,
'We are God's, and unto Him we shall return!  You
have darkened the light of my eyes, oh Frank! but
may the fiends have me if I take not a sure and
terrible vengeance for this!'
</p>

<p>
'Hear me?' I implored, without knowing what to
say.
</p>

<p>
'Nay&mdash;stir not a step, or these balls shall whistle
through your brain!'
</p>

<p>
'Yuze Bashi, hear me, I beg of you, and you shall
know all.'
</p>

<p>
'All!' he reiterated, stamping with rage; 'ye
shall wish yourselves like the brutal Greeks, from
whom this woman sprang&mdash;deaf and dumb and
without understanding&mdash;before the measure of my
vengeance is full.  Her fate she knows; but for <i>thee</i>,
accursed Frank&mdash;thou who hast reft me of her, who
was to be unto me a garment and a comfort, as the
blessed Koran saith&mdash;by the seven heavens and the
seven earths, and by the hand that hung and cleft
the moon in the firmament, I will have your heart to
tread beneath my heel; but first the ferashes shall
apply the bastinado until every toe you have has
dropped from your feet in blood!  Hallo, Chaoush!
Hallo, Onbashi!'
</p>

<p>
'Do with me as you please, Effendi, but spare
her.'
</p>

<p>
'As for her, the hand of a profligate Christian has
touched her&mdash;a hand which defiles all it touches&mdash;yea,
even the food of a dog; so, from this hour, she
is alike divorced&mdash;thrice, I say it, divorced, divorced
and accursed by Hussein!'
</p>

<p>
With these words, he pulled both triggers at once;
but the pistols, having old flint locks, by the mercy
of heaven, flashed in the pan and hung fire.  Then,
finding the necessity of immediate action, just as he
was about to draw his sabre, I grasped him by the
gilded waist-belt, and hurling him, with all my force,
back upon the cushions which lay piled upon the
floor behind him, I locked Iola into an inner
apartment&mdash;kissed her cold hands, and rushed by a back
door to the foot of the staircase.  Then crossing the
castle-yard, I regained my quarters, where I was
immediately joined by Callum Dhu, who, ever kind and
watchful, had been awaiting my return.
</p>

<p>
Alarmed, on seeing me spring in with my sword
drawn, and excitement in my eye,
</p>

<p>
'In the name of the devil, co-dhalta,' said he,
'what is the matter?'
</p>

<p>
I told him that I had been visiting the wife of the
commandant; that he had returned suddenly, and
finding us at coffee, had been seized by a fit of
jealousy, and nearly pistolled me; but that I had knocked
him down, and made my escape.
</p>

<p>
This explanation was all truth, and yet was but a
compromise between it and falsehood; and so I
thought Callum suspected, for his keen dark Highland
eye loured; his face flushed for a moment, and
he gave me a glance of scrutiny such as he had
never ventured to do as my fosterer in Glen Ora, and
still less since we had joined the regiment.  Beside
all this, Callum Dhu was sufficiently well read in the
writings of Morier, Frazer, Slade, and Franklin to
know that the domestic privacy of an oriental household
cannot be trifled with, and, after a moment's
reflection&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Glen Ora,' said he&mdash;for he never forgot my old
Highland patronymic&mdash;'evil will come of all this,
for you have been unwary; and there will be the life
of one&mdash;it may be three&mdash;lost.  Have you thought
of that?'
</p>

<p>
'I <i>have</i> thought of it,' said I, irritated on finding a
Mentor in him; 'and I tell you, Callum, that I care
not whose life is lost, if the poor innocent Greek girl
I have compromised is saved from the ferocity of this
Turkish officer.'
</p>

<p>
'True&mdash;but how?' was the calm query.
</p>

<p>
'How&mdash;I care not how; but saved she must be,
Callum.  As for that true type of an Eastern tyrant&mdash;the
ignorant, sensual, and avaricious Hussein&mdash;what
care I for him?'
</p>

<p>
'Yet he trusted to your honour, Allan Mac
Innon!'
</p>

<p>
I felt the quiet reproach, and dared not follow up
my own thoughts, for I felt how weak is the human
heart, and vain the resolves of human reason, when
opposed to the wiles of beauty.  Lest some outrage
should be attempted upon me, as we knew not what
lengths the Yuze Bashi's wrath might carry him,
Callum suggested that one of our men should be
posted, with his bayonet fixed and musket loaded, at
the foot of the stair which ascended to the tower
wherein we had our quarters; and, to watch over
the safety of Iola, my faithful fellow proposed that
he and Donald Roy, who was a sharp-witted, active,
and hardy West-Highlander, should guard by turns
the residence of the exasperated governor of Rodosdchig;
and after these arrangements, I sat down to
write to Jack Belton for his advice, and composed
the letter, and my own mind, over a devilled bone,
a bottle of Kirkissa wine, and cigar.
</p>

<p>
During my conference with Callum we heard
various noises and cries of alarm proceeding from the
quarters of the Yuze Bashi; and each of these
sounds had a terrible echo in my heart, for, when
believing that they proceeded from the apartment of
Iola, the main strength of my fosterer scarcely
sufficed to restrain me from rushing out, sword in hand,
to her assistance.
</p>

<p>
All became quiet after a time.  Then we heard the
clatter of horse's hoofs, as a mounted messenger
galloped from the fort, which made me suspect that our
Yuze Bashi had sent some awkward instructions to
the Bostandgi Bashi of the police; or worse still, to
some of the lawless Bashi-Bozouks, an orta or
regiment of whom, were cantoned at Carga, not far from
us; but ere long, we learned that it was only a slave,
dispatched by Iola for a certain learned Jewish
Hakim, who arrived in due time, and reported, that
after imprecating a torrent of maledictions on 'the
chief of the bare-legged <i>Yenitcheries</i>,' as he termed
the brave steady lads of her Britannic Majesty's
&mdash; Highlanders, the Yuze Bashi had suddenly become
speechless and black in the face; that his eyes had
started in their sockets, and he became senseless, as
if ghoules or ghinns were strangling him; that he
was recovered only by bleeding and having his
temples bound with a fillet, on which were traced the
signs of the Zodiac.  After this, he was able to make
known that he wished to see the Moolah Mustapha,
who had accordingly been sent for.
</p>

<p>
The plain English of all this I supposed to be,
simply, that Hussein, being very short in stature,
stout, pursy, and thick-necked, in his phrenzy had
brought on a fit of apoplexy, the effects of which&mdash;if
they had no better cure than the signs of the
Zodiac&mdash;I believed would at least keep him quiet until
I was recalled to Heraclea by Major Catanagh, an
event for which I now devoutly prayed.

A morning or two after this, there was no small
consternation existing among the soldiers of my little
band at Rodosdchig, when Dugald Mac Ildhui, my
sergeant, paraded them as usual, and neither Callum
Dhu nor his master were forthcoming.  Corporal
Donald Roy was despatched to make inquiries, but
returned to the parade with tidings that he had
knocked repeatedly at Mr. Mac Innon's door without
receiving any answer; and as it was open, he had
ventured to peep in, and saw but too plainly that his
camp-bed had not been slept in over-night; that the
last fragment of an unextinguished candle was still
burning, but streaming and guttering on the table;
that his sword and belt and some of his uniform lay
strewed about; but that neither he nor Callum Dhu
had been seen since last night, when the Turkish
sentinel at the barrier-gate thought he perceived
them both pass hurriedly out, and take the path
which led towards the sea.
</p>

<p>
The faithful sergeant and his corporal spent that
day, all the next, and all the succeeding in vain
surmises and in futile inquiries; no trace of their officer
and missing comrade was to be found; and as the
story of Hussein's rage and imprecations against me,
for causes unknown, had by some means&mdash;perhaps
through the chaoush or onbashi of the Bombardiers&mdash;reached
the little band of Celts, they began to look
darkly and inquiringly in each other's faces, while
vague whispers of assassination gained strength and
corroboration among them.  The sergeant and his
corporal had been among the wandering Highland
dancers who went to Paris in 1848, and were so near
being shot by the Republican troops for appearing
kilted and plaided, with dirk and claymore, in the
Place de Carrousel; and having imbibed thereafter a
great doubt of, and detestation for, all foreigners
whatsoever, they came to the conclusion that we had
met with an untimely end.
</p>

<p>
The circumstance of a boat being found by a Galiondgi
adrift near the castle, containing an officer's
regimental sash, spotted with blood, and a Highland
private's Glengarry bonnet, increased this terrible
mystery, and led the soldiers to believe that, beyond
a doubt, the unfortunate Ensign Mac Innon and his
<i>fidus Achates</i> had become food for the fishes of the
Propontis, and the whole beach around the bay was
searched in vain for their bodies.
</p>

<p>
The sergeant&mdash;a sober, steady, and brave soldier,
one of the many who were daily forced from their
homes into our ranks, for he was an evicted Sutherland
Highlander (evicted because he was unable to
pay the marriage-tax of forty shillings now daily and
illegally exacted by the grasping factors of the north
and west Highlands from the people, to keep the
number of the population down)&mdash;procured a thin
yellow sheet of Turkish paper, and after holding a
solemn council of war, in which a vote of vengeance
was unanimously passed on the Yuze Bashi, who was
still under the Jewish Hakim and the signs of the
Zodiac, he squared his elbows, made a broad margin,
carefully nibbed his pen, and proceeded to prepare
an official report to Major Catanagh, recounting
the strange disappearance of the officer commanding
the detachment; and this report caused no small
excitement at the mess-table when it reached
Heraclea.
</p>

<p>
Some weeks elapsed before this mystery was cleared
up; and the origin of it all was as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
One evening, after the arrival of the Moolah
Moustapha, of whose presence at the fortress I had an
intuitive dread, an unusual bustle, and then a dead
silence were remarked in the apartments of the Yuze
Bashi; and in half an hour after sunset, Callum Dhu,
with his dark face flushed and excited, came in haste
to inform me, that a boat&mdash;one of those straight
prowed and heavily-built craft, called by the Turks a
kochamba&mdash;with several men in it, had come from
the harbour round the promontory of the castle, and
was now close to the sea staircase, a flight of steps
hewn in the rocks near the lower gun-battery.  He
added more startling intelligence.
</p>

<p>
A loud whistle, as a signal, had been given by someone
in this boat, and thereafter two men, one of whom
he suspected to be the Moolah Moustapha, had left
the postern gate, half leading and half dragging a
veiled woman, 'who sobbed heavily,' concluded.
Callum, 'but who made not the least resistance, as if
all hope in her heart was dead, poor thing!'
</p>

<p>
I cannot express the horror with which I heard
this information.  Innumerable stories of Turkish
cruelty, of the burial of living women, sacked and
drowned in the Bosphorus; of the gashed and
mangled bodies of others that have been found across
the cables of our own ships, or were raked up by
them, as they swung at their anchors by the Golden
Horn; of bodies stranded and torn by jackals on the
shore at Pera, with a thousand real and imaginary
instances of the terrible result of oriental jealousy and
domestic cruelty, flashed upon my memory, and I
determined to save Iola from the dreadful fate
impending over her, or to die in the attempt.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning of Islamism&mdash;women who were
supposed to have broken their vows were stoned to
death, or immured in a stone wall; for the fourth
chapter of the Koran commands that they shall be
"imprisoned in separate apartments until death
release them."
</p>

<p>
'You are my foster brother, and will stand by me,
Callum?' said I, grasping his hand.
</p>

<p>
'To the death will I stand by you; but on what
errand go you now?'
</p>

<p>
'To save this woman.'
</p>

<p>
'The wife of the Yuze Bashi.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;the Greek girl, Iola.'
</p>

<p>
'From what?'
</p>

<p>
'Death!'
</p>

<p>
'Death?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;yes! hand me my dirk and the shot-belt for
the revolver; get your bayonet.  The Yuze Bashi
means to drown his wife in a sack&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Dhia! it is horrible!&mdash;like a puppy-dog.'
</p>

<p>
'Or, it may be, to behead her by a slash of a yataghan.
If either takes place, her blood will be on our
heads, Callum&mdash;on mine, at least.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't understand all this; but, dioul!  I will
follow YOU anywhere, Mac Innon&mdash;so lead on.'
</p>

<p>
I slung my dirk and revolver-pistol to my belt;
Callum buckled on his bayonet; we hurried from the
castle, and soon reached the landing-place, where a
few boats were usually moored.
</p>

<p>
The night was dark and cloudy; no moon was
visible, and the sea of Marmora lay between its
headlands like an ocean of ink; yet, by stooping low, I
could perceive between me and the white streak that
lingered at the horizon a large boat, containing several
dark figures, being pulled like a great funeral barge,
silently and rapidly to seaward.
</p>

<p>
''Tis those we are in search of,' said Callum, as we
leaped on board of a little Greek caique, slashed
through the painter, shipped the oars, and pulled
sturdily and breathlessly after them.
</p>

<p>
In such a land as Turkey, where, in 1808, the
Sultan Mahmoud II. could quietly, and quite as a
matter of course, or as a piece of state policy,
strangle his deposed brother Mustapha IV., together
with his infant son; and also command four of his
female slaves to be sacked and drowned, because they
were likely to increase the royal family by presenting
him with four little Harem-zadehs; where even his
son, the present Sultan Abdul Medjid, with all his
vaunted civilization, has committed more than one
act of domestic barbarity, more especially the
assassination of the two little princes, his nephews; and
where too many of the atrocities recorded by travellers
in all ages are <i>still</i> perpetrated, I knew all that hung
over the doomed wife of Hussein; all I had to repent
of, and all I had to fear!
</p>

<p>
Ill-fated Iola!
</p>

<p>
While all the rest of the world has been pushing on
the rapid march of <i>progression</i>, Turkey like Spain, has
stood still.  The Turkish woman, says the Baron de
Tott, when inspired by an irresistible love and desire
of freedom, overcomes every obstacle, and at times
escapes from the harem, her domestic prison.  'These
unfortunate creatures,' he continues, always carry off
their jewels with them, and consider nothing too good
for their lover.  Blinded by their unhappy passion,
they do not perceive that this wealth often becomes
the cause of their destruction.  The villains to whom
they fly never fail at the end of a few days to punish
their temerity, and ensure the possession of their
effects by a crime which, however monstrous, the
government is least in haste to punish.  The bodies
of these miserable women, stripped and mangled, are
frequently seen floating in the Port (of Constantinople)
under the very windows of their murderers; and these
dreadful examples, so likely to intimidate the rest, and
prevent such madness, neither terrify nor amend.'
</p>

<p>
But to resume: surely, steadily, and lustily, with all
our strength, Callum and I shot the light caique after
the great dark barge of these voyagers in the dusk, at
every stroke causing her to fly through the seething
water as with each effort of the bending oars we
almost lifted her into the air, and made the black
waves boil in her white wake astern.  The clatter and
straining of our oars between the tholing pins, and
the noise made by the caique as it surged through the
water, soon gained the attention of the rowers in the
large boat, which was now about half a mile from the
shore, and they paused for a minute to observe us.
Then one black figure stood erect, and peered into
the gloom of the darkened sea.
</p>

<p>
He was the Moolah Moustapha.
</p>

<p>
The voice of one in authority now warned us to
keep off, for the large boat contained two topchis, of
Hussein's company, and four armed policemen of the
Bostandgi Bashi, with one or two galiondgis.
</p>

<p>
'Dioul!' exclaimed Callum; 'what is he saying?'
</p>

<p>
'That they will fire, if we do not keep off.'
</p>

<p>
'How many of them are there?'
</p>

<p>
'One&mdash;two&mdash;six&mdash;seven, if not more.'
</p>

<p>
'Including the Moolah?'
</p>

<p>
'Who is almost nobody.'
</p>

<p>
'Two to six, at least,' pondered Callum.
</p>

<p>
'But I have six shots in my revolver.'
</p>

<p>
'If I had only my old rifle here,' sighed Callum,
'I could pick them all off like black-cocks!'
</p>

<p>
Two pistols flashed from the kochamba, and threw
a sudden gleam across the water; but their bullets
whistled harmlessly over us.  Exasperated by this,
my foster-brother cried,
</p>

<p>
'Kill every mother's son of them, Mac
Innon&mdash;quick&mdash;before they reload again!'
</p>

<p>
But I dared not fire, lest one of those dark figures
should be Iola.
</p>

<p>
'Pull hard,' said I; 'we are not twenty yards
apart now; board and attack them with your
bayonet&mdash;I'll make good use of my dirk, believe me!'
</p>

<p>
'Fire&mdash;fire! are they not three to one?'
</p>

<p>
'One Highlandman is equal to three Turks any day.'
</p>

<p>
'True, Mac Innon,' exclaimed Callum, entering at
once into the spirit of the attack; 'hoigh&mdash;hurrah!'
</p>

<p>
But never was assault more fatally devised, or
more signally unsuccessful.
</p>

<p>
In a moment the prow of the caique came with a
frightful crash against the quarter of the lumbering
kochamba; the shock threw me forward upon the
thwarts, by one of which I was severely cut and
bruised about the face, while I narrowly escaped three
pistol shots, one of which grazed and slightly wounded
Callum's left hand; but our misfortunes were only
beginning; for in the concussion I lost my revolver-pistol.
On relinquishing the oar, and springing up, I
instinctively grasped for it at my waist-belt&mdash;but
alas! the pistol was gone.  For a moment I groped wildly
and fruitlessly about the bottom of the caique,
without finding it; and then, as no time could be lost,
with my naked dirk, I sprang madly on board the
kochamba, followed by Callum, who made free use of
his bayonet, and now a deadly struggle took place;
the Turks assailing us with batons, drawn sabres, and
the brass knobs of their long-barrelled pistols, amid a
storm of yells and barbarous maledictions.
</p>

<p>
Grasping one powerful galiondgi by the waist,
Callum flung him fairly overboard, tossing him into
the air like an India-rubber ball; and he was left by
his fatalist friends to sputter and sink, or scramble on
board as best he could.
</p>

<p>
The huge boat swayed from side to side, plashing
and surging heavily, while we fought and grappled
like wild animals; but though individually more
than a match for any of the Osmanlies present, Callum
and I were overborne by their number, and must
inevitably have been shot, stabbed and tossed
overboard, but for the exertions and authority of the
Moolah Moustapha, who would not allow them to slay
us; but under pain of his everlasting curse and
displeasure, commanded them to spare our lives, "as he
had eaten bread and salt with us."  Though four of
the fellows whom we encountered, and with whom we
had exchanged several buffets, blows, and stabs in the
dark, belonged to the unscrupulous force of the
Bostandgi Bashi, or Police Inspector on the banks of the
Bosphorus and its adjacent villages, the voice of the
Moolah, who ordered us to be taken alive, proved all
powerful.  We were soon beaten down, and severely,
roughly, even brutally, tied like sheep with a wet
rope which lay steeping in the bilge at the bottom of
the boat; and while we were lying helplessly there,
the revengeful Osmanlies trampled and spat upon us,
reviling us at the same time with such epithets as can
only come from a vituperative Turkish tongue.
</p>

<p>
'Allah burn you, you dog's sons&mdash;you imps of
Shaitaun!' said one whom they frequently named
Zahroun, and who seemed to be half Bostandgi and
half seaman.
</p>

<p>
'The drunken Inglees&mdash;whose dogs are they?'
asked another, mockingly.
</p>

<p>
'They worship the devil, like the wild Yezidies of
Iraun&mdash;the children of hell, and are false as the falsest
Yahoudi.  Dirt be upon their beards!' said the
ferocious Zahroun.
</p>

<p>
'Son of Shaitaun,' said another, kicking me so
severely that I thought my right arm was broken,
'it is your khismet (destiny) to die here, and I know
not why the simple Moolah spares you.'
</p>

<p>
'Infidel that you are,' said a fourth, 'your khismet
is written on your forehead by the finger of the
prophet&mdash;and it is a skinful of the cold Bosphorus.'
</p>

<p>
To all this, the others added coarse and vulgar
ribaldry, such as one might expect from the boatmen
and Bostandgi of the Bosphorus, a depraved and
murderous class at all times; and my heart swelled with
honest rage when I thought of the futile war we had
waged for those insensate Turks, whose name had not
been heard in battle since our army landed in the
Crimea, and who, with all their boasted valour, had
fled at Balaclava, and left a single Highland regiment&mdash;"<i>the
thin red streak</i>" of Sir Colin Campbell&mdash;to receive
in line the charge of all the Russian cavalry!
</p>

<p>
But now the Moolah raised his voice.
</p>

<p>
'Bismillah&mdash;peace, I command you, peace!  Allah
permits them yet to live, and dare such as ye to
repine?  We come not here to brawl or to revile, but
to fulfil the decrees of Allah as spoken by his prophet,
upon whose memory, name, and grave be all the
blessings of the faithful.  The home of a true
Believer&mdash;the anderun of a true Mussulman&mdash;one fearing
God, obeying his Koran, and walking in the shadow
of the prophet, has been violated, and the Koran and
the law say, that a terrible punishment must follow!'
</p>

<p>
'Amaun! amaun!' muttered Zahroun and all the
others present, while a moan from the stern of the
boat drew my eyes towards Iola.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
Would that I could blot from my memory the
dreadful scene that followed!
</p>

<p>
Worn by nights and days of weeping&mdash;exhausted
by unavailing prayers for pity, and paralyzed by
terror, there seemed to be no life left in her slender
and delicate form, save what a short, quick, and
heavy sob indicated, as her small and tremulous
hands were tied by a cord behind her back; and,
calm and pale as death itself, she submitted to her
fate without a murmur.
</p>

<p>
'Moustapha&mdash;insensate Moolah!' I exclaimed, in
an agony of mind, 'hear me&mdash;hear me!  Have you
no pity?&mdash;no mercy?&mdash;no compassion for those who
have been cruelly tempted?'
</p>

<p>
'Peace, accursed,' replied the Moolah, in a stern
whisper, '<i>we tempt ourselves</i>.'
</p>

<p>
As a degradation, the executioners had torn away
the yashmack of muslin from her face, and its pale
beauty and divine resignation were sad, sublime, and
maddening to me; but a large, coarse sack was hastily
drawn over her by Zahroim, who seemed an adept in
the work; he tied it securely to her slender ankles, and
saw her form no more.
</p>

<p>
A cry escaped me, and a half-suppressed groan
from Callum Dhu, as these inhuman wretches launched
her headlong into the deep.
</p>

<p>
She sunk like a stone! * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
On the black waves of that midnight sea there rose
a few bubbles, and a ripple or two, that widened
round us, and then all was over!  A voice broke the
stillness; it was that of the Moolah praying.  He
was repeating the first chapter of the Koran; a short
chapter held in great veneration by the Mohammedans,
who use it us a prayer, and deem it the quintessence
of the whole writings of the Prophet.
</p>

<p>
'Allah latif magid!' (Allah is gracious!) he
exclaimed, with a loud voice: 'the Lord of all
creatures&mdash;the most merciful the King of the day of
judgment!  Thee do we worship, and of Thee do we beg
assistance.  Direct us in the right way&mdash;in the way
of those to whom Thou hast been gracious&mdash;not of
those against whom Thou art incensed and who go
astray.'
</p>

<p>
'Amaun! amaun!' muttered all the ruffians, bowing
their heads, as they shipped their oars again, and
now the huge and lumbering koehamba was slowly
pulled away from the place; from that hideous grave&mdash;the
inky wafers that had swallowed up Iola Vidimo.
</p>

<p>
In the morning I was beloved by a beautiful
woman&mdash;at night by an immortal but scarcely purer
spirit; and with eyes full of tears for her who had
passed away, I gazed upward on the starlit sky of
Greece.
</p>

<p>
The passages of that night seemed all a hideous
and incredible dream.
</p>

<p>
Iola was the most artless of all earthly beings, for
in many things she was a mere child, and can aught
be nearer angels, or more akin to heaven, than a
child?  But so perished this unhappy one; so pure,
so unstained and beautiful&mdash;the victim of a pitiless
destiny!

<h3>
CHAPTER XLVIII.
<br /><br />
THE TURKISH BOAT.
</h3>

<p>
Our craft had been for some time in motion before I
became aware that a large lateen sail was hoisted on
it, and was filled to the extremity of its long and
tapering yard; and that our course was directed, not
to Rodosdchig, but up the sea of Marmora, towards the
north-east.
</p>

<p>
I demanded of the Moolah Moustapha whither he
was conveying us, but received no answer.  Again
and again I made the same request, each time with
growing anger and vehemence, and each time adding
threats of what our Government would say, or do, or
require, curiously oblivious that I had, in my own
person, outraged the civil and religious laws of
Turkey, such as they are; but still the Moolah disdained
to accord me the slightest answer or recognition,
and sat, with his hands folded in his green robe
and crossed upon his breast; his high felt cap pulled
over his beetling brows; his keen and glittering eyes
fixed upon the eastern quarter of the sky, where the
dawn was shedding a rosy tinge over all the land and
sea; and the rough galiondgis or boatmen, and the
pistolled, sabred, tarbooshed, and bearded policemen
of the Bostandgi Bashi were equally taciturn, though
Zahroun scowled and swore at us from time to time.
</p>

<p>
Now I conceived that they might be conveying us
to one of the old castles at the mouth of the Bosphorus,
or perhaps to Constantinople, but the distance
was rather too great to be traversed in an open boat
at the season of the year.
</p>

<p>
Day dawned at last; morning brightened on the
Grecian hills, and the outline of many a grim old
tower and ruined temple, crowning the grey rocks
and storm-beaten headlands, stood in dark relief
against the blushing east.
</p>

<p>
Upon that sea, which mirrored all the morning
sky, I gazed with a shudder of horror, for it was the
grave of my poor Albanian girl, and her pale, wan face,
her beautiful eyes, and angelic smile, came before me
with painful distinctness; while, with a morbid grief,
I endeavoured to imagine on what coral bed, in what
deep and unfathomable rift or abyss of that huge
watery tomb, on which the waves were shining in
the orient sun, her charming form had found a last
resting place.
</p>

<p>
Poor Iola!  I could not yet realize her death, or
the conviction that if I was to go back to Rodosdchig
I would not meet her at the Ruined Hermitage, in the
express cemetery, or in the silken-hung apartments
of Hussein, where I had last spent an evening with
her.  The events of the last night still seemed all a
hideous nightmare, or the memory of some terrible
phantasmagoria.
</p>

<p>
'It is long before we become assured of the loss of
those we value,' says a charming female writer; so
her dying glance was still lingering before me, and
shall be so, in years to come, when other memories
may have been swept away and effaced, like
footprints on the shore of an ebbing sea.
</p>

<p>
With emotions of rage and hatred, difficult alike
to express and to control, I turned from her destroyers,
and hid my face in my hands, as this bitterness
was replaced by anguish and remorse.
</p>

<p>
The kochamba continued to run at great speed
before a sharp breeze which blew direct from the
narrow Dardanelles, and the rocky capes, the sandy
bays, and wooded inlets opened and closed again in
rapid succession, as we passed them with a flowing
sheet, and ere long Callum and I recognised the
flat-roofed town and barracks of Heraclea, with the old
ruins of the age of Vespasian, and the white foam
curling on the rocks of Palegrossa, where the timbers
of the <i>Vestal</i> lay&mdash;a rent and weedy hull.
</p>

<p>
I now hoped that the Moolah and his ruffians
meant to land us there, and deliver us up to our own
commanding officer, and with this idea my spirit rose
a little.  The familiar faces of our mess came before
me; rough Duncan Catanagh, with his old legends
about Loch Lomond and stories of the Mahrattah
war: frank Jack Belton, and others among whom I
had felt happier than ever I hoped to be after the
time I had laid my mother in her lonely Highland
grave, and since I had been driven from Glen Ora
into the wide and selfish world; but this gleam of
liberty faded away, for the kochamba still bore on;
her head was kept to the seaward, and in another
hour Heraclea was left astern.
</p>

<p>
What could be the Moolah's object, and whither
was he going?
</p>

<p>
Ere long a British screw-steamer-of-war&mdash;a frigate
under easy sail, and with her steam up&mdash;passed us to
leeward, on her way apparently for the Bosphorus,
and Callum and I gathered new hope as she came
close to us, with her scarlet ensign swelling proudly
on the morning breeze, and with the sun shining
through her open gun-ports.  I arose in the boat,
believing that my scarlet uniform might arrest the
attention or excite the suspicion of those on board;
but I was instantly thrust down below the thwarts;
a pistol was held to my head by Zahroun; then a
tarpaulin, was thrown over Callum and me, to
conceal us more completely from any prying eye that
might be aloft in the steamer's rigging, and steadily,
swiftly, and monotonously the kochamba continued to
cleave the glittering waves and run along the coast of
Roumelia.
</p>

<p>
Our Turkish captors were all smoking opium and
coarse Latakia in taciturn composure; some had small
chibouques, and others cigarettes made up of paper
and tobacco, from those little embroidered bags
which an Osmanli is seldom without.
</p>

<p>
Several hours had now elapsed since Callum and I
had been tied so roughly by ropes, and these being
wetted by the salt spray, had shrunk to a degree that
caused us intense and acute pain.  My hands became
red, swollen, stiff, and benumbed; and with something
of satisfaction I saw the lateen-sail trimmed
anew, the helm put up, and the prow of the kochamba
turned inwards a town which we were nearing.  But,
still my mind was painfully full of Iola&mdash;my poor
victim&mdash;for conscience made her seem as much the
victim of my folly or recklessness&mdash;term it as you
will&mdash;as of the cruelty of that Osmanli dog her
husband, whom I had registered a hundred vows to
pistol on the first opportunity.
</p>

<p>
Could I have recalled the events of the last few
weeks Iola had still been spared, for my rashness
would now have been tempered by reason and the
ties of honour; and she had still been a thing of life
and of this earth, enjoying the monotonous and
secluded existence accorded to a Turkish wife&mdash;varied
only by an evening ramble in the City of the Silent
with the gossips of adjacent harems and anderuns.
</p>

<p>
The kochamba bore straight and steadily on, and
as we neared the harbour, every object increased
along the shore, and soon we were in smooth water
and between the piers.
</p>

<p>
This, then, was the place of our destination, and
here it was that probably poor Callum and I were to
figure before one of those absurdly solemn courts of
muftis and kadis who sit in every Turkish town to
play the farce of Justice, and whose code of law is
the verbose and obscure Koran of Mohammed, and
the Koran alone.
</p>

<p>
Again I ventured to question the Moolah.
</p>

<p>
'What place is this?'
</p>

<p>
'Selyvria, in the Sandjiack of Gallipoli,' was the
brief reply, as the boat came sheering alongside the
low and slimy mole.  Then the yard was lowered,
and the flapping sail stowed away; the long oars were
unshipped, and the painter run through one of the
enormous iron rings on the quay.
</p>

<p>
We were ordered to land, and lost no time in doing
so; then the policemen of the Bostandgi drew their
sabres and conducted us into the town, where an
increasing crowd of chattering Greeks and gambolling
young Turkish <i>gamins</i>, with brown, bare legs and red
tarbooshes, followed us through the muddy and unpaved
thoroughfares with shrill cries of astonishment,
amid which the incessant 'Mashallah,' 'Inshallah,'
and 'Allah Ackbar,' were the most prominent.
</p>

<p>
The sun had set now and the aspect of the sea and
land was magnificent.
</p>

<p>
Throned in the eastern heavens, the soft and silver
moon was in all her clearest splendour.  The studded
belt of Orion and the constellation of the Scorpion
united with her in filling the wide blue vault of
night with lustre, and all the waves of Marmora
seemed to be tipped with blue fire and to be rolling
in liquid light.
</p>

<p>
Built on the slope of a hill, the terraced houses of
Selyvria were irregular, quaint, and queer, like those
of all Turkish towns, and they rose above each other
like the seats of an amphitheatre.  The hill was
green, and on its summit rose a fortress of the Greek
Empire&mdash;old, say some, as the days of Selys, who
founded the city.  The lower, or Turkish town, is
without enclosure, though an embattled wall connects
the outer row of houses, above which rise the domes
of its khan and several mosques.
</p>

<p>
On leaving the town we were conducted along an
ancient bridge of about forty arches, the shadows of
which were thrown by the moonlight far across the
salt sea-marsh, over which it is built.  Thence
proceeding by a part of the paved road that leads to
Stamboul, and is formed of blocks of basalt, we found
ourselves beneath the walls of a grim and dilapidated
castle, which stands close to the sea-shore.  On one
hand the waves of the Propontis lay rolling in
shining ripples on the yellow beach, and inland, on the
other, spread a wilderness of wild vines and cherry-trees,
with massive Grecian columns, tottering or
prostrate among them, and beyond these a spacious
burial-place, with all its shadowy, huge, and solemn
cypresses, standing like a rank of giant spectres in
the brilliant moonlight.
</p>

<p>
Above our heads towered the black parapets, the
peering cannon, and the red-capped sentinels of the
Turkish castle.  Then the wild and strange voices of
the Osmanli soldiers were heard, as the Onbashi of
the Bostandgis conferred with the Mulazim who
commanded the guard; the heavy doors were opened,
and as we entered a cold and dark archway, we heard
the chink of bolt and bar and swinging-chain, as the
barrier was secured behind us; and then the ropes
were untied from our almost powerless hands&mdash;an
inexpressible relief!
</p>

<p>
'Dioul!' muttered Callum, with a shrug of his
shoulders, 'we were better at home in desolate Glen
Ora, even under Snaggs the factor, than here.'
</p>

<p>
Before I could reply, we were pushed through a
side door, and thrust down a flight of steep and slimy
steps, into a hot, close, and noisome place, where the
sights, sounds, odours, and horrors that awaited us,
require an entire chapter to themselves.

<h3>
CHAPTER XLIX.
<br /><br />
THE BAGNIO.
</h3>

<p class="t3">
'Truth is strange&mdash;stranger than fiction.'
</p>

<p>
Never were words more expressive of what is passing
around us daily in the world, even in its most
matter-of-fact scenes and phases of life.  Many a deep and
bitter romance is occurring beside us, amid the bustle
of the railway train; on the deck of the departing
steamer; with the regiment embarking for foreign
service, or with the disbanded soldier returning to
search for his parent's cottage, and finding perhaps a
manufacturing town, where he had left a rural
village; amid the hum of the streets, in the brilliance
of the crowded ball-room&mdash;in all these are thoughts
and wishes, fears and aspirations, known only to Him
who reads the hearts of all.  Hence though my autography
may seem a romance to the reader, it is a true
and painful history to me.
</p>

<p>
Thus, as I have related, on the very day the late
treaty of Peace was signed at Paris&mdash;to wit, the 30th
March, 1856, or according to the Mohammedan Hejira,
1271&mdash;Callum Dhu and I found ourselves inmates of
a Turkish Bagnio, an event of much more importance
to us than the definement of the Bessarabian frontier,
the fall of Sebastopol, or the acceptance of the "five
points" by Russia.
</p>

<p>
We were thrust into a large, vaulted apartment, in
the sunk or ground-floor of the fortress.  It was damp,
and pervaded by an atmosphere so fœtid, hot, and
humid, that for a time it was all but overpowering,
and denied us free respiration.  A dim iron lantern
hung from a pillar on one side, and shed a cold and
wavering light into the misty dungeon, which was
half seen and half sunk in shadow.
</p>

<p>
This darkness seemed dotted at certain distances
by swarthy visages, fiercely browed and blackly
bearded, with wild gleaming eyes; and on our British
uniforms being seen, the clanking of chains rang on
all sides, with incessant yells of
</p>

<p>
'Bono Johny!'
</p>

<p>
'No Bono!'
</p>

<p>
'Barek-allah&mdash;no Bono!'
</p>

<p>
And after a time, Callum and I could perceive that
we were surrounded by about fifty prisoners, all of
whom were chained to the four walls, and almost
within arms length of each other.
</p>

<p>
'Ingleez!  Ingleez!' shouted one.
</p>

<p>
'Giaours of Frangistan!'
</p>

<p>
'May they all go to Jehannum!'
</p>

<p>
''Tis their kismet.'
</p>

<p>
'And who can avert it?'
</p>

<p>
'Bono&mdash;bono!'
</p>

<p>
'No bono&mdash;wallah!'
</p>

<p>
'Hah-ha!  Hah&mdash;ha!'
</p>

<p>
Such were the cries and yells we heard on all sides,
mingled with groans, idiot or ferocious laughter,
brutal jests and scurrility, in all the dialects of the
Bosphorus and the Levant.  Many of these prisoners
were nude, or nearly so, and their muscular limbs and
olive skins were fretted by the massive and rusty
fetters which confined them to the walls on each side.
Others were clad in every diversity of oriental
costume, fashion, and colour.  We could perceive the
blue gown of the Jew; the torn but ample white robes
of the Armenian; the gay cap of the short-trousered
Greek; the fur pelisse of the hawk-eyed Tartar; and
the red tarboosh that covered the woolly head of the
Egyptian; but all these men were squalid, tattered,
and beyond description, filthy.  Assassination,
robbery, and a thousand crimes of the deepest die, were
legibly stamped on the hideous fronts of this crew of
hardened desperadoes; and we shrank from their
touch, on each side, as we hovered in the middle, and
kept carefully beyond their reach, for I had once
heard of a prisoner who was placed in a Turkish
bagnio unchained, a privilege which so greatly exasperated
his fettered companions, that they flung, beat,
kicked, and tore him from man to man, until his
mangled corpse defied their further efforts at insult
or torture.
</p>

<p>
Most of these prisoners, as I afterwards ascertained,
were men who had committed those foul murders and
robberies, such as, since the war, are nightly occurring
in the dark, unlighted, unpaved, and narrow streets
of Stamboul&mdash;that Stamboul, boasted by the Turks as
'the refuge of the world&mdash;the city full of faith;' and
these fierce denizens of the prophet's patrimony,
would all, ere long, receive the reward of their crimes
in some form of law; for though the land is almost
lawless, its punishments, like its people, are barbarous
and severe.
</p>

<p>
For several days and nights Callum and I remained
together in this hideous place, ignorant of
what fate had in store for us; whether we were to be
detained there in hopeless captivity; whether we
were to be brought before a court of malevolent
muftis and ignorant kadis; or whether we were to be
delivered to our own military authorities; to the
Turkish, or to that enterprising ambassador who has
immortalised himself by the <i>anxiety</i> and diplomatic
<i>energy</i> he evinced during the defence of Kars; and
from whom, by his conduct on that occasion, we had
so much to expect in the form of protection and aid!
</p>

<p>
By day, Callum and I paced to and fro in the
centre of this dreadful place, keeping apart from all
our companions, and we soon became almost as oblivious
of <i>their</i> presence, as they were of ours; and
during this monotonous time our sole employment
was watching the long flakes of misty light which
streamed through four iron-grated apertures or narrow
slits down to the Bagnio; and which, like four
palpable objects, passed slowly round from one side of
the dungeon to another, as the sun declined and day
faded away.  At these holes the Turkish sentinel,
with his scarlet fez, dark moustachioed face, and
cunning eye, was seen at times peering into the place to
see if "all was right;" and through these apertures,
I was told, they had been wont to fire ball-cartridge,
when any unusual commotion took place among the
prisoners.
</p>

<p>
At night we crouched together in a corner,
somewhat apart from the rest, and weary of communing,
surmising, and conjecturing, slept the sleep of the
anxious and worn&mdash;that waking and painful doze,
which is but a succession of nightmares and visions,
till dawn again struggled through the misty atmosphere,
to light up the quaint forms and ferocious faces
of these fettered wretches, and to bring the Turkish
guard, with their daily allowance of black bread and
fresh water, when again would begin the usual chorus
of laughter, groans, and curses, mingled with the
swinging and clashing of fetters and chains, bolts and
padlocks of rusty iron.
</p>

<p>
Among the unfortunates confined in this place I
discovered two who were treated by our guards with
more kindness and respect than the other prisoners,
and whose stories somewhat interested me.
</p>

<p>
One was hopelessly insane; and the other, who
was indeed sunk to the lowest depth of misery and
dejection, informed me that they had been lieutenants
(Mulazims) in the Turkish military service.

<h3>
CHAPTER L.
<br /><br />
THE TWO TURKISH LIEUTENANTS.
</h3>

<p>
'I am Achmet Effendi,' said the latter, a handsome
but pale, sad, and emaciated young man; 'I was a
lieutenant in the old regiment of Scherif Bey, and, as
a mere boy, served in the campaign of Egypt.  My
younger friend whom you see here so heavily visited
by heaven and the prophet, that his mind is gone or
possessed by a devil, so that he requires chains and
bars three times heavier than the most powerful
villain here, is Ali Effendi, a Mulazim of artillery,
and there is none better or braver in the army of his
Imperial Majesty the Sultan.
</p>

<p>
'He was with that Turkish army which on the
28th October, 1853, crossed the Danube, and on the
4th of the following month won the victorious battle
of Oltenitza, where he slew the aide-de-camp of the
Russian General, and found those important
despatches which informed us, but alas! too late, of the
intended attack upon Sinope, where four thousand
five hundred of the Faithful were slaughtered by the
dogs of the Czar.
</p>

<p>
'Ali Effendi was next engaged and severely
wounded at the battle of Kalaphat on the 8th of
January, 1854&mdash;you may still see the scar of the
Russian bullet on his bare right arm, above the iron
fetter.  Ali is tall&mdash;he was then handsome and
winning; a clever poet and maker of verses; an expert
player on the guitar, but poor; for, like myself, he
had only one hundred and twenty piastres per month,
as a lieutenant en seconde, of Topchis.
</p>

<p>
'For five years he had loved and been beloved by
the daughter of a wealthy Stambouli merchant, and he
had received her plighted troth.  You may know all
the danger, the difficulties, and the deadly snares that
hover round a Turkish love; yet the skilful Ali had
surmounted and escaped them all, and won the love
of Saïda.  But her father discovered them, and he
was inexorable, of course&mdash;fathers always are so, for
they are the evil Genii of all love stories, and so he
proposed to barter or sell her to Ali Pasha himself!
</p>

<p>
'Poor Ali, my friend, was marched off with his
brigade of artillery to fight the Russians under
Mouravieff at Kars, and the unhappy Saïda was in despair
when the Pasha sent the dressmakers from the bazaar
to measure her for the bridal attire and pearl slippers.
Then her grief and fury could no longer be controlled;
and bruising the crystal pendant of a lamp to powder,
she drank it in a cup of sherbet and expired, with the
name of Ali on her lips, and a copy of his last farewell
verses, written on fine silk, pressed to her heart.
</p>

<p>
'Kars fell!  Its garrison was captured, but Ali
escaped the Cossacks of Mouravieff, and hastened home
to find Saïda, not as of old, at her chamber window
to answer the tinkling of his lute at night, when the
quiet stars looked down on the blue Bosphorus, and
the thousand lights of Stamboul were shining on its
waters; but to seek her green grave among the silent
ones at Pera, and he was almost beside himself with
grief.  Three days he remained on his knees at her
resting-place, until he had read over all the hundred
and fourteen chapters of the Koran, and covered the
grass with flowers.  Then he placed above her a
gilded tomb, on which he wrote in charming verses
the whole history of their hopeless love; and this
tomb cost the poor lieutenant nine hundred piastres.
Beside that tomb he swore a dreadful vow to slay
both Ali Pasha and her father.
</p>

<p>
'While this rash vow was trembling on his lips,
that father of cruelty and avarice, the old merchant,
tottering on his staff, and with tears rolling down his
white beard, appeared under the tall and sombre
cypresses of the cemetery; and then the frantic Ali,
transported with rage, sprang up from amid the
flowers of Saïda's grave, and drawing a pistol from his
girdle, shot him dead!
</p>

<p>
'From that moment Ali became a maniac, and the
sultan sent him here.  Allah has dried up his brains;
but He is ever merciful and just; so whether my poor
comrade shall recover, and be as he was in other
times, a merry companion, a true friend, and gallant
soldier, I know not; our kismet is in the hands of
God and the Prophet, whose holy finger traced it, at
the moment of our birth, upon our infant brows.'[*]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
[*] Ali <i>did</i> recover, and is now a <i>cole agassi</i> (major) of the
Turkish artillery at Hunkiar Skellessi: but being, as Jack
Belton says, in full possession of his senses, vows he will never
think of marriage more.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'A mournful story, Achmet Effendi,' said I, gazing
with deep interest on the hollow cheek, lack-lustre
eyes, and wasted form of this brave young officer,
who had seen as much service, and fought with the
gallant Williams at Kars; 'but, if I may inquire,
what brought <i>you</i> here?'
</p>

<p>
'Love, also,' he answered, with a smile, and then a
frown of anger on his olive brow.  'A few words will
tell you all.  My father is the Bashi-katib or military
secretary of the Egyptian Contingent.  The orta or
battalion to which I belonged, and still belong&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Still belong?' I reiterated, glancing at his fetters,
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' said he, colouring, 'you shall hear.'
</p>

<p>
'I was in cantonments at Pera, when I became
acquainted with a lady who was wont to walk,
unattended either by slaves or carpet-spreaders, in the
great cemetery there&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Ah!' said I, with mournful interest.
</p>

<p>
'Her figure was graceful; her brow like alabaster;
her eyes&mdash;strange in our sunny land&mdash;were a deep
and bewitching blue, for her mother had been a Russian
lady, stolen from the shores of the sea of Azof.
Her eye-brows were brown, and arched, like the
moon of the Prophet, and never did the divine Hafiz
of Iraun pen a sonnet on a face more beautiful than
hers; and as Jammee the Iraunee sings in his ode, I
was miserable when absent from her.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Oh! in what place soe'er I stray,<br />
  By midnight, morning, or by day,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art the inmate of my breast;<br />
  I cannot linger, cannot stay,<br />
  But thy sweet image with me aye<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abides my bosom's dearest guest!'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Yet she was <i>another's</i>, and by one of the contrarieties
of our nature for that reason, more perhaps than for
her loveliness, did I love her! she was&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'A wife?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'What then?'
</p>

<p>
'A slave.'
</p>

<p>
'Well?' said I, thinking it was only a distinction
without a difference among 'the Faithful.'
</p>

<p>
'Her master was in the service of the Kislar Aga,
so you will perceive at once that she was a dangerous
person to meddle with.  The arrival of the allied
troops in the Bosphorus had attracted the attention
of all in Stamboul, so Pera was almost deserted.
Zarifa, by a prettily-arranged bouquet of flowers, asked
me to visit her, and I did so, taking care, however,
to arm me well.  I had my sabre and a pair of
pistols, which I loaded carefully, in case of being
surprised by the Kislar Aga or any of the black guardians
of the Royal Seraglio.  I had with me a fleet horse,
one of those carefully-trained barbs which are used
by our Turkish cavalry, and are drilled to close to the
right and close to the left; to dress back, or forward,
at a single word of command; to remain beside the
rider if he falls, or to drag him out of the press by
their teeth.  Leaving my horse concealed in an
olive-thicket, without perceiving that I was watched and
followed by a Moolah, named Moustapha, who had
been a corporal in my regiment, I entered the garden
of the Kislar Aga's country-house, and there Zarifa
received me in a beautifully-gilded kiosk, covered
with tendrils of the myrtle, the passion-flower, the
gorgeous azalea, and the Damascus rose.  There soft
carpets were spread; hot coffee, sherbet, wine, and a
chibouque awaited me&mdash;and more than all, Zarifa, in
all her beauty, with her yashmack thrown aside!
</p>

<p>
'Reclining on that soft carpet, with my arm around
the yielding waist of my love&mdash;a pipe on one hand, a
cup of Greek wine on the other, I was in the seventh
heaven!
</p>

<p>
'The roses were sparkling in the new-fallen rain,
which had just refreshed the earth with a shower,
and the sun was exhaling it, as he came up in his
splendour; the breeze was laden with the melody of
the joyous birds, and the large drops hung like diamonds
on every flower and tree, while the perfume of
the orange-groves, of the violet-beds, and of the china
jars of heliotrope, loaded the air with delicious
fragrance; everything spoke to my heart of love,
delight, and silence, as I pressed my lips to those of
Zarifa!
</p>

<p>
'At that moment the gleam of three or four bayonets
appeared above the garden wall; the door of
the kiosk was dashed in; I sprang to my feet, with a
hand on my sabre, to be confronted by the scowling
Moolah, who, I found, to my rage, had surrounded me
by a guard from the nearest police-station.  In short,
the ruffians of the Bostandgi Bashi were upon me!
</p>

<p>
'Zarifa uttered a shriek, as I rushed from her, to
find my horse captured, and bayonets opposed to me,
breast-high.  I was obliged to surrender at discretion,
and on being deprived of my arms, was thrust into an
araba, and, with the terrified and weeping girl, was
taken before a corrupt and cunning kadi.
</p>

<p>
'"Remember," said I, "that I am the son of tho
Bashi-katib, and the grandson of the Seraskier."'
</p>

<p>
'"You are wise to boast of your ancestry since you
cannot boast of yourself," sneered the Moolah.
</p>

<p>
'"Did not the Prophet cast eyes of evil on Zeinab,
the wife of Zeid, his adopted son, from whom he
cajoled her away and then married her; and Zeinab,
thereafter, vaunted that she was above all the other
wives of Mohammed, since their marriage was made
in heaven?"
</p>

<p>
'"Peace, blasphemous kite!" exclaimed the kadi.
</p>

<p>
'He then asked me, according to our law, when a
man is discovered in the society of an unmarried
woman, if I would wed Zarifa?
</p>

<p>
'But I remained silent.
</p>

<p>
'Zarifa was beautiful, and I loved her&mdash;true; but
to marry the slave of a servant of the Kislar Aga, the
Chief Eunuch to that son of a slave, the Sultan; I&mdash;a
Mulazim&mdash;on one hundred and twenty piastres per
month.  Wallah! the thing was not to be thought
of!  I refused, and was sentenced to pass two years
in chains.  Zarifa was given to a deserving chaoush
of cavalry as a wife, and I was sent here as a
prisoner, and as such must remain a few months longer."
</p>

<p>
'And you were sentenced to pass two years in
chains?'
</p>

<p>
'Two years, Effendi.'
</p>

<p>
'Heavens,' thought I, 'should such be my sentence,
what will become of Callum Dhu, and what
will be the fate of my commission, which I value as
my own life!'
</p>

<p><a id="chap51"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LI.
<br /><br />
DREAMS AND LONGINGS.
</h3>

<p>
'If I were cast into a deep pit,' saith the quaint
Hobbes, 'and the devil put down his cloven-foot, I
would take hold thereof, to be drawn out by it.'
</p>

<p>
This is an apt, but somewhat fallacious application
of the mode of working ascribed, with what truth I
say not, to the Jesuits, viz., that we may do evil if good
should come of it; and of the system upheld by the
philosopher of Malmesbury, 'that it is lawful to make
use of an ill instrument to do ourselves good.'
</p>

<p>
Callum and I, though sunk in dejection, dispirited,
and exasperated, and feeling ourselves fitted to
attempt or encounter anything desperate to achieve our
liberty, had scarcely reached the climax referred to
by the learned Hobbes.  I thought of bribery; but
my foster-brother, though poor as a cadger, was proud
as a king, and with some scorn rejected my proposal
to tamper with our not over-scrupulous Turkish
guards and turnkeys.
</p>

<p>
These officials (as Achmet Effendi informed me),
by the connivance of the governor and his subalterns,
could favour or permit the escape of the worst
malefactor committed to their care, if there were friends
without, who were ready to pay down the requisite
number of piastres, on receipt of which their names
would at once be struck off the books of the Bagnio
as dead.
</p>

<p>
'Suppose cholera should break out here?' said I,
one day, when almost suffocated by the overpowering
malaria of the prison.
</p>

<p>
'In the name of mercy do not think of it!'
replied the Turkish lieutenant; 'I have seen that
dreadful pest more than once within these walls, and
all the Koran says of hell cannot equal the horrors of
the scene.  The dead, collapsed, pale, and frightful,
have lain among us in their chains for days, until the
governor, by offers of liberty, bribed some of the
prisoners, and by threats of death forced others, to
convey them from this vault, into which the vilest of
his slaves refused to enter.'
</p>

<p>
These brief conversations increased my desire to
leave the place.  My horror of it; my anger at being
detained; my anxiety for the issue, and for the
construction which the regiment might put upon my
unaccountable disappearance, with a thousand other
exciting reflections, rendered me at times only fit
company for a maniac.  Often my spirit sank to the
lowest ebb; and, crouched at the foot of a pillar, with
my head resting on kind Callum's brawny shoulder,
I have slept, or striven to sleep, through the long and
dreary hours of a monotonous night, after the equally
long and dreary hours of a horrible day.  And even
these snatches of uneasy slumber were filled by
countless dreams, visions, and thoughts of incidents
long past, and places, faces, and voices far, far away.
</p>

<p>
Amid all this misery I thought much of Iola, who
was now where her errors would be more lightly
judged than by the sons of men.
</p>

<p>
Strange it was that when I dreamt of her&mdash;her
death, that scene of horror, seemed all <i>a dream</i>, that
had passed away with night and sleep.  She was
again alive and beside me, as of old, with her soft
angelic smile!  Again her lips were warm and
breathing; and her breath came hot and fragrant, as
her white bosom palpitated against mine.  Dear Iola!
Then the atmosphere seemed dense and full of
languor; again I was trembling, dazzled, and confused
with delight, as she lay within my arms in all her
Oriental beauty, waking in my heart a thousand
thoughts and aspirations hitherto unknown to me.
</p>

<p>
Then her face would fade like the dissolving
views of a magic-lantern; melting half away, it
changed and brightened into another that resembled
Laura Everingham; then I would start with a
convulsive shudder and awake, to find around me the
grizzly, unshaven, and dreadful visages of my Asiatic
and Turkish companions, with all the horrors of that
earthly hell, the Mohammedan Bagnio.
</p>

<p>
Many a time the scenery of my native land came
before me.  Again, in fancy, I trod the purple heath,
and heard the roar of the Uisc-dhu, as it thundered
over its steep precipice into the black linn below;
again I saw my mother's grave, and the old jointure-house
shining in the sunlight; the lofty scalp of Ben
Ora capped with the snows of the past winter, and
its sides clothed with bronze-like thickets of larch
and pine; again I saw the azure loch on which the
wild swans floated, bordered by its groves of silver
birch, of wavy ash, and the rowan with its scarlet
berries; and out of that deep, dark, and pestilential
vault, the desolate glen of the Ora passed thus before
me like a panorama, with all its moss-grown hearths
and roofless homes; the waving woods, the rocks,
and mountains, shining under a glorious sun.
</p>

<p>
On waking from dreams like these my spirit sank
lower, but sturdy Callum never quailed, for he cuffed
and kicked the Turkish prisoners, and sang 'The
Brown-eyed Maid,' or whistled endless and interminable
pibrochs, as he said, 'just to relieve his
mind and let off the steam a little.'
</p>

<p>
Anon I was with the regiment again&mdash;'roughing
it,' among rough and gallant spirits, who hovered
round me in all the glittering appurtenances of
Highland chivalry.  I heard the comic song, the glee, the
laughter of the mess; or I was again at sea on board
the <i>Vestal</i>, passing over the waste of water like a
floating spirit, and gliding along the dim and distant
coasts of France and Spain&mdash;that seemed pale and
blue by sunny day, and dark by starry night&mdash;or lit
only by the solitary light-houses that burned like
ocean-stars upon the horizon's tremulous verge;
on&mdash;on&mdash;on the wings of steam, swiftly, silently, and
mysteriously.
</p>

<p>
Iola still!
</p>

<p>
It would come before me again and again, that
face of tender beauty and reproachful sadness.  Her
eyes were ever on me, by night, when all was
darkness and profundity; and in the day-time, when the
misty flakes of sunshine fell through the prison-bars,
in waking or in sleeping, they were ever gazing on
me&mdash;those dark and sad, but sweet imploring eyes.
</p>

<p>
Eve fell even in Paradise&mdash;why not Iola?
</p>

<p>
With such thoughts for my companions, how heavy
was my sorrow, how dull and monotonous my captivity!
</p>

<p>
At last, even Callum, who could boldly face all
those disagreeables which usually rise like dust along
the roadway of life, began to sink under the weariness
of our existence in this hideous place; and once, to
my surprise, I discovered tears hovering in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Co-dhalta,' said I, kindly, placing a hand on his
shoulder; 'what are you thinking of?'
</p>

<p>
'I am thinking, Mac Innon, of that green place
where God gives rest to the weary&mdash;the old kirkyard
at home, where your mother and mine, too, are
sleeping under the shadow of the old stone cross;
and I was pondering on&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What?'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Our</i> chances of ever being laid beside them.'
</p>

<p>
'Let us rather think of escape.'
</p>

<p>
'To work, then,' said Callum, briskly; 'let us not
continue to waste what little Father Raoul was wont
to term the poor man's best inheritance?'
</p>

<p>
'What may that be, Callum?'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Time</i>,' was the pithy reply.
</p>

<p>
This brief conversation was interrupted by the
arrival of two more prisoners, who were immediately
greeted by the usual appalling chorus of yells, cries,
curses, and laughter, together with that clattering
accompaniment of chains, bolts and fetters, which had
so strangely startled Callum and me on our first
entrance to this Cimmerian and infernal abode.

<h3>
CHAPTER LII.
<br /><br />
THE GALIONDOI.
</h3>

<p>
Escorted by a party of Turkish police, or personages
armed with similar authority, and accoutred with
yataghan and pistols, of course, for these are as
indispensable to an Osmanli as his nose and eyes, our new
companions who entered were two hideous and ferocious
Asiatic Turks, with receding foreheads, sharp
temples, ana shaggy eyebrows&mdash;black and sinister
eyes&mdash;hooked noses and long moustaches, having a
savage curl, round almost to their ears.  While they
were being secured by the legs to the wall, a gleam
of sunlight from one of the grated slits fell upon
them, and I recognised Zahroun and another of the
Turks who had assisted the Moolah Moustapha in
committing Iola to her dreadful tomb amid the waters.
</p>

<p>
I stepped towards them, with a dark frown on my
face and a twitching in my hands, as if I could have
sprung upon their throats; and Callum followed me
close, with a gleam in his dark eye that betokened
mischief.
</p>

<p>
Zahroun recognised us, and pointed his dirty
brown fingers at me with mockery, while his
companion gave us but a scowl and a sullen stare.
</p>

<p>
'Chaoush,' said I, to the sergeant of the guard, 'of
what have these men been guilty?'
</p>

<p>
'Murder and piracy,' replied the soldier, briefly,
as he drew a key from the fetter-lock of Zahroun.
</p>

<p>
'Murder!&mdash;where?&mdash;near Rodosdchig?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;for murdering a Frankish officer off the
coast of Natolia a night or two ago, in a solitary
caique; but they are safe enough till the ferashes of
the Bostandgi Bashi lead them out to take their last
view of the setting sun.'
</p>

<p>
Yells, hoots, and groans, whistling and laughter,
greeted the chaoush as he retired, and I turned away
with aversion from the two wretched assassins who
had been added to the number already round us.
But their arrival excited a little curiosity in this
strange community, and by those who were chained
on each side of them, and opposite, they were loudly
and vociferously pressed to relate the story of their
crime and the cause of their incarceration there.
</p>

<p>
It was briefly told, for the Turk is neither verbose
nor circumlocutory.
</p>

<p>
They, and a few others, all well armed in a fleet
caique, were hovering about the coast of Natolia, on
the look-out for any smaller craft they might be able
to overpower or pick up, when they discovered, in a
creek of the opposite Isle of Marmora, an English
pleasure-yacht ashore, wedged upon the sand, and
left almost dry, as her crew, without the assistance
of a large steamer, were totally unable to get her off.
Barek Allah! here was a prize!  A well-found,
taut-rigged, sharp-prowed, and strong English yacht, of
some three hundred tons, pierced for twelve
eight-pounder carronades, and handsomely fitted up.
</p>

<p>
In those disorderly times, when the shores of Asia
Minor were swarming with lawless bands, and Greece
was vibrating with incipient insurrection, what
havoc could be made in the Archipelago with such
a craft as this English yacht!  But then her owner
was a sturdy, burly old infidel, who, since she had
gone ashore, had stuck a huge cutlass and four
pistols in his girdle.  He had a well-picked crew of
forty men, all well armed, and who loved fighting
better than idleness, for these Ingleez galiondgis
were the very devil!  He had on board, also, a British
officer from Sebastopol, and two Ingleez ladies,
beautiful as the houris of Paradise, moon-faced and
cushion-hipped (and here the hideous Asiatic rolled
his black goggle eyes, and licked his blubber lips),
and so the yacht with her twelve brass guns, plunder,
et cetera, was deemed well worth venturing one's
hide under pewter and steel for.
</p>

<p>
While Zahroun and his companion Abdul Basig
watched her in a little caique, pretending to fish by
day and to sleep in an adjoining creek by night;
others, their comrades in many a crime, were scouring
all the sea-port towns about Rodosdchig and the
Natolian coast, to muster enough of lads on whom,
by old experience, they could depend&mdash;choice and
sturdy sons of the handjiar and pistol, to assist in
surprising the grounded yacht some cloudy night
when the moon was below the horizon, and no help
was nigh; for with enough of hands she could easily
be boarded in the dark&mdash;the throats of the Ingleez
cut from clew to earring, and then the whole craft,
with all her plunder, provisions, women, wine, plate,
and everything, would belong to the captors.
Inshallah! was it not a notable speculation?
</p>

<p>
'One evening,' continued this exulting ruffian,
'Abdul and I were hovering near the creek in our
caique, looking at the stranded yacht, and admiring
her beautiful mould, and clean run under the counter,
as she lay with a heel over to her port side, when
suddenly, while we were speaking, her colours were
run up to the foremast-head to gain our attention,
and a giaour on deck waved his hat to us.  Then we
pulled alongside, but cautiously and slowly.
</p>

<p>
'The Effendi to whom she belonged had grown
weary of lying in a few feet of water among the woods
of that secluded creek, and impatiently proposed
that, for so many piastres, we should convey the
bearer of a message towards the mouth of the Dardanelles,
where he would be sure of falling in with one
of the many British cruisers, whose captain would at
once lend him all the assistance necessary, on merely
mentioning his name; for this stout old infidel in the
square-tailed coat, white trousers, and straw hat,
evidently deemed himself a great man in his own
country; and so perhaps he may be, for Abdul tells
me that it is an island of white chalk, where the sun
never shines, and whose shores are surrounded by a
thousand leagues of mud; and that its mountains are
peopled by Arnaouts, who wear a striped camise
round their middle like yonder giaour (pointing to
Callum Dhu), and that they have tails&mdash;Allah Ackbar!&mdash;of
which, however, they are deprived by the
Moolahs at their birth.
</p>

<p>
'Be that as it may, we agreed with the Frankish
Effendi to take his messenger to a castle of the
Dardanelles, and for three hundred piastres, which
were at once paid over the capstan-head, to set off
that very night.  Before he left the yacht, his
messenger, a handsome Ingleez captain&mdash;a Yuze Bashi
in the Guards, and bearded like a Janissary, or like
all those infidels who come from the war, kissed the
unbelieving women before descending to our boat&mdash;kissed
them before us all, without their yashmacks;
and then we put off, set our sail, shipped the sweeps,
and pulled away to sea.
</p>

<p>
'The night was beautiful, and muffled in a coat
which had a hooded cape like that of a Bashi Bozook,
the Ingleez captain lolled in the stern-sheets of the
caique, smoking cigars, speaking, as all these Ingleez
do, about the weather, and looking upward at the stars,
or back to the Isle of Marmora, where he had left his
two wives, for such I took the women to be; but now
the Isle was diminished to a dim blue speck upon the
waters, and we could no longer see the creek where
the yacht lay.
</p>

<p>
'He had a fine ring on the fourth finger of his left
hand; it flashed as he gave us each a few cigars, and
lit a fresh one for himself.  He had a noble gold
watch (all these infidels have such), and he looked at
it from time to time, as he hummed a song, and after
telling us to "pull like devils, as we should be well
paid," fell fast asleep, for he feared nothing.
</p>

<p>
'Abdul and I continued to pull, but less vigorously
than before.  We looked slyly at each other, and
thought of the watch and the ring.  The sea was very
quiet and smooth; there was not a ripple on it, and
no eye beheld us, but the winking stars.  The infidel-dog
slept soundly, and he was smiling in his sleep,
as he dreamt perhaps of his two Ingleez wives, or his
island of mud and fog, for we could see his white
teeth shining under his dark moustache in the
starlight.  We were some miles off Cape Karaburun, for
we could see its lighthouse glimmering on our lee.
Everything was quiet and lonely as it may well be
upon the midnight ocean.  We exchanged another
glance, and in a moment more, the throat of the
infidel was gaping with a red slash of my handjiar,
which nearly cut his head off!
</p>

<p>
'Abdul Rasig made a snatch at the gold watch, and
just as we tossed him overboard, I tore off the diamond
ring with my teeth, and, Allah Kebir! a mouthful of
his unclean flesh came off with it; but here it is&mdash;the
ring, not the flesh!'
</p>

<p>
In the excitement of his narrative the wretch forgot
himself so much as to exhibit the ring.  It was a
chaste little jewel&mdash;a pure diamond, set round with
pearls; and on beholding it, I started back as if a
thunderbolt had burst at my ear.
</p>

<p>
That identical ring I had seen a hundred times on
the finger of Laura Everingham; and I had last
observed it, to my pique and grief, on the hand of her
lover&mdash;her husband Clavering&mdash;when he dined at our
mess in the Castle of Dumbarton!
</p>

<p>
Astonishment and horror chained all my faculties,
and meanwhile the exulting Zahroun continued his
revolting narrative.
</p>

<p>
'We flung him over, and he sunk like a stone;
then we put the helm up, and bore away for the
river Ustuola, our point of rendezvous on the coast
of Natolia&mdash;a lonely place, where all our armed caiques
were to meet for attacking and taking the yacht.  But
a storm came on; wallah! a storm of wind and
lightning, a flash of which shaved my left whisker
clean off, as you may see; we were driven up the
Sea of Marmora, and after losing both sweeps and
sail, were drifting at the mercy of the wind and tide,
when an armed boat of the Bostandgi Bashi&mdash;may
dogs defile his beard!&mdash;overhauled us, just when we
were quarrelling and mauling each other about the
respective merits of the watch and ring, for Abdul
Rasig was wrathful at the splendour of my diamond,
vowing, that for every para the watch was worth I
had got a piastre, and a para being worth only the
thirtieth part of a piastre, four of which now go to
make a shilling Ingleez, we loudly accused each other
of murder and robbery, like the fathers of fools.
</p>

<p>
'The Kadi before whom we were brought carefully
wound up the watch, applied it to his ear, and as it
ticked to his satisfaction, he solved the matter by
depositing it in his judicial pocket.  He would also
have quieted me, by slipping my ring on his finger,
but I placed it in my mouth, and swore, by every
hair in the boards of the two hundred and twenty-seven
thousand prophets of Islam, that I had swallowed
it; then we were marched off to the Bagnio,
and so are here.'
</p>

<p>
'Ay, here we are, a thousand burning curses on
your folly!' growled Abdul; 'for the four caiques
will leave the mouth of the Ustuola on the fourth
night from this; the yacht will be boarded and taken,
and neither of us will be there to share the plunder
or the pleasure; and wallah!  I had set my whole
soul on having one of those white-skinned Ingleez
women!'
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LIII.
<br /><br />
A ROW IN THE BAGNIO.
</h3>

<p>
It is impossible for me to analyze my thoughts or
reflections, on hearing this terrible relation of Clavering's
lonely and helpless butchery in his sleep, by the
hands of villains such as these Turkish galiondgis.
</p>

<p>
Poor Tom Clavering! his well-whiskered face and
manly figure came vividly before me, as I had last
seen them in Dumbarton Castle, when he seemed the
jolliest of our merry mess; and when full of joy at
his approaching marriage, and all thoughtless that I
was his rival, he spoke to me of his love for Laura;
of her beauty, and that which was better than beauty,
her worth; and when, in the fulness of his heart,
he generously placed his purse at my service with all
the frankness of a soldier and of an English gentleman.
</p>

<p>
But he was gone, and Laura was a widow now.
</p>

<p>
A widow at two-and-twenty, or thereabout!
</p>

<p>
Here was food for thoughts of hope and ardour, for
now she would be free to choose another; and though
the pale image of Iola still hovered painfully and
oppressively before me at times, I felt that I loved
Laura still.  Then came the crushing and startling
thought of the dangers which menaced her, and the
words of the villain Abdul were yet tingling in my
ears.
</p>

<p>
'<i>The caiques will leave the Ustuola on the fourth night
from this, and the yacht will be boarded and taken!</i>'
</p>

<p>
Taken by those Greek pirates and Turkish outlaws
whose savage barbarity have long made terrible the
shores and isles of the Ægean sea!
</p>

<p>
So Laura was with me in this land so distant from
our home; she was within a few miles of me, and a
great longing seized my soul&mdash;a longing to look once
more upon her face&mdash;to hear her voice again; the
voice that in other times had thrilled through my
inmost heart, which now began to 'ache with the
thought of all that might have been;' but it stood still,
forgetting almost to beat, while my blood ran cold at
the reflection that I was a prisoner, and totally
incapable of assisting, warning, or protecting her or her
friends.
</p>

<p>
All my soul seemed now to be with that stranded
yacht on the Isle of Marmora, which was more than
forty miles distant, as a bird would fly.
</p>

<p>
Oh, to be free! my longing and my horror were
fast becoming insupportable.
</p>

<p>
How often had the same unavailing exclamation
left my lips, as with clenched hands, and teeth that
gnawed my nether lip, I trod to and fro in wretchedness,
despondency, and bitterness of heart, in the
narrow passage or aisle formed by the double line of
captives chained on each side of the Bagnio.
</p>

<p>
I had long since discovered the futility of attempting
to soften, bribe, or terrify the chaoush who
commanded the guard, for he feared us, as prisoners of
the Moolah Moustapha; thus the rascal seemed
incorruptible.
</p>

<p>
The story of Clavering's fate, and the adventure of
the diamond-ring, haunted me as much as the doom
that overhung the yacht of Sir Horace and her crew.
Could I rest while, almost within arm's length of me,
there was this jewel which had been on the white
hand of a pure and innocent English girl like Laura
Everingham (and which, moreover, had been her gift
to a brave and honest hearted fellow like Clavering)
remaining in possession of a vile and polluted assassin
like Zahroun?
</p>

<p>
Twenty times I stepped towards him, with the
intention of clutching his throat, though he seemed to
possess thrice my strength; and I as often drew
back on reflecting that, in case of a brawl, I might
be torn to pieces by the prisoners if I came within
arm's length of them, or perhaps I might be shot by
the guards from without, as Achmet Effendi informed
me that, on scuffles ensuing, they frequently fired
through the gratings, without the least remorse or
ceremony; and he added, that if we escaped a round
of ball-cartridge we would assuredly be chained, like
the rest, to the walls.
</p>

<p>
To Callum Dhu I translated the horrible story of
Zahroun, and the honest heart of my foster-brother
was fired with rage and sorrow when he heard the
fate of Captain Clavering.  The frank and manly
bearing of the English Guardsman, with his love of
old Highland sports, had made a most favourable
impression on the mind of my follower, whose heart
was apt to become somewhat encrusted by jealousy
and prejudice on the approach of strangers; and
now, whispering fiercely in my ear, he swore by the
stones of Iona to tear the head off the shoulders of
Zahroun.
</p>

<p>
The sunset had faded away; the eight reflections
of the eight narrow slits which, from a shady verandah,
admitted light into our vault, had disappeared
from the stained and dirty walls; the place was so
dark that we could not see each other's faces, as on
this night the chaoush of the Turkish guard had
omitted to light the lantern which usually swung
from a pillar of our den; or perhaps the quartermaster
of the castle had no oil in store; but what
ever the reason may have been, we were left quite in
the dark when I finished my translation of the story,
and then Callum Dhu, filled by a sudden tempest of
Highland fury, and regardless of all consequences,
sprang upon Zahroun, and seizing him by the throat,
endeavoured to hurl him beneath his feet; but the
bare-legged and bare-armed galiondgi was brawny,
muscular, and strong as himself, so the struggle that
ensued between these two athletes was alike fierce
and terrible!  Their hard, constrained breathing;
their half-suffocated exclamations, threats, and
execrations in hoarse Gaelic on one hand, and guttural
Turkish on the other, were drowned amid the noise
made by the prisoners, who began their usual infernal
chorus of shrieks, yells, oaths, and laughter, with
loud and impetuous inquiries on all hands as to what
was the matter, while the general row was increased
by the swinging and dashing of chains.
</p>

<p>
'Callum!  Callum!' I exclaimed, 'here are lights&mdash;the
Turkish guards may fire upon us.'
</p>

<p>
'Let them blaze away!' was the answer of Callum,
who, wholly intent on battling with his ferocious
antagonist (whom he had now beaten to the ground,
and on whose brawny chest he had planted his kilted
knees), heeded me not, for his Celtic blood was
fairly up, and his mouth, moreover, was full of it, as
Zahroun, with one of his iron fetters, had given him
a blow on the jaws.  While they continued to fight
thus, like two wild panthers, writhing, twisting, and
struggling, sundry pleasant adjectives in their
different languages were resorted to.
</p>

<p>
'Dioul!' was freely invoked on one side, and all
the genii of hell, with the beards of the twelve
imaums, and the same reverend appendages of the
two hundred and twenty-seven thousand prophets of
Islam wore summoned in vain on the other, while the
storm of swinging chains and clamorous voices rang
in the arched vault like the bellowing of a stormy
sea.
</p>

<p>
A red light flashed fitfully through one of the iron
gratings, and the swarthy visage, heavy moustache,
and scarlet fez of the Turkish sergeant appeared, as
he held up a flaring torch and gazed in, with
something of wonder and alarm in his dark and dilating
Asiatic eyes.  The iron door was hastily opened, and
several soldiers, clad in short blue jackets, and tight
red trousers, ran down the steps, and preceded by
the chaoush with the torch, began to lay about them
on all sides with bamboo rods, caning all without
discrimination.
</p>

<p>
As the sergeant rushed forward, a prisoner, in sheer
mischief, put out a foot and tripped him up.  With
a malediction the non-commissioned officer fell flat on
his face, with the burning link almost in his mouth,
by which&mdash;Barek Allah!&mdash;his sacred moustaches
were scorched off in a moment; and as the light went
out, two or three of his comrades fell over him in the
dark, increasing the confusion.  A hand now grasped
mine with fierce energy.  It was Callum's.
</p>

<p>
'Now,' said he, 'now or never! follow me!'
</p>

<p>
And he dragged me up the steps and through the
open door, which we could easily distinguish by a faint
light beyond it.  As we issued into the yard before
the Turkish guard-house, Callum, with admirable
presence of mind, closed the barrier of the vault,
turned the key, and by an additional wrench broke
it in the lock, leaving the chaoush and his soldiers to
fight or fraternise with the prisoners, as they pleased.
</p>

<p>
'Let us be but through the outer barrier, and we
are free!' said I.
</p>

<p>
The night was starry but dark, for the moon had
not yet risen, and an increasing wind rolled the waves
of the Propontis on the rocky beach.
</p>

<p>
There was no time for calm deliberation; no
leasure to undo an error, for we had nothing to guide
our decision but the quickness of instinct and the
rapidity of desperation.  Our lives would be lost or
won in less than five minutes&mdash;a dreadful reflection
to me, even now, when all the danger is over and I
sit in my quiet quarters writing of what is all happily
past.
</p>

<p>
The gate was closed and secured by a transverse
wooden bar.  Muffled in his blue greatcoat, the
Turkish sentinel stood near it, with his musket on
his shoulder, and the long bushy tassel of his scarlet
cap drooping down his back.  I could mark his sharp
Asiatic features defined against the sky.  He stood
still and motionless as a bronze statue, with his
lacklustre eyes fixed on the stars, and absorbed apparently
in one of those waking dreams peculiar to those
Osmanlies who spend their spare paras in opium and
raki.
</p>

<p>
'Mac Innon,' whispered Callum, 'to you I leave
the undoing of the gate; give me the sentinel to
manage&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'You will not kill him?' said I, hurriedly, seeing
that there was a wild gleam in Callum's eyes, and
that he had, between his teeth, a skene-dhu, which,
by being concealed in his hose, had hitherto escaped
the search of our captors.
</p>

<p>
'Kill him? not if I can help it; but I would
rather be shot here, sir, than go back to that infernal
prison.  Dioul! do you hear how the old chaoush is
bellowing at the door?'
</p>

<p>
Roused by the unusual noise, the dreamy sentinel
turned his head half round to listen, and at that
moment Callum sprang upon him, and grasped his
throat with a clutch into which he threw all the
muscular strength of his sinewy arms and fingers.
The swarthy visage of the poor Turk became distorted;
his eyes almost started from their sockets,
and the musket fell from his shoulder.  I snatched
up the weapon, and (while Callum hurled the soldier
to the ground) endeavoured to throw off its iron hooks
a solid cross bar that secured the wicket in the gate,
which was composed of strong vertical palisades.
</p>

<p>
This bar was secured in its place by a chain and
large brass padlock, the key of which was probably
at the belt of the chaoush, whose outcries we dreaded
would momently rouse the rest of his comrades in
the little fortress.
</p>

<p>
Heavens, what a chaos were then my thoughts!
All seemed a dream, and we did everything as if in a
dream; yet all we did was wisely and correctly done.
I unfixed the bayonet from the musket; inserted its
triangular blade into the loop of the padlock; grasped
the socket with my right hand, the point with my
left, and using the weapon as a lever, wrenched it
fiercely round, and burst the impediment.  Thus the
chain which secured the bar was loosened; the
wicket stood open, and the sentinel lay breathless on
the ground.
</p>

<p>
'I hope the poor fellow will soon recover&mdash;he was
only doing his duty,' said I.
</p>

<p>
'He'll be able to bawl for help in three minutes;
Dioul! if he does, I'll go back with my skene and
gralloch him like a dead deer; see he is stirring
already!' said Callum, as we leaped through the gate;
and intent only on placing the greatest possible
distance between ourselves and the Bagnio of Selyvria,
hastened along the sea-shore, avoiding the high road
which traverses the rugged coast, and which we
naturally supposed would be the first line of search and
of pursuit.

<h3>
CHAPTER LIV.
<br /><br />
FLIGHT.
</h3>

<p>
The shore was sandy, broken here and there by
masses of black rocks, and fringed by groves and
thickets, which afforded every means of concealment,
if we were pursued.  Moreover, many little caiques
and fishing-craft were moored in the creeks and inlets
for nearly three miles beyond Selyvria: thus we had
every means of escape to seaward, if closely pressed
by the soldiers from the castle.  I had still the
sentinel's loaded musket; but was resolved to toss it
into some pool of water or olive-thicket when day
dawned, lest the circumstance of having it in my
possession might excite remark or suspicion; and we
intended to pass ourselves off to the Osmanlies as
shipwrecked British prisoners, escaped from a Greek
pirate&mdash;a story probable enough, if told at a moderate
distance from Selyvria.
</p>

<p>
A hundred times we paused anxiously to listen,
assured that we heard the noise of pursuit, rising
above the far-sounding murmur of the eternal sea
that rolled upon the sandy beach.  Now it seemed
the baying of dogs; then the tramping of horses on
the paved road that led to the bridge of the Saltmarsh;
next it was the tread of men's feet and the clink of
accoutrements; but these were all the effect of an
over-excited fancy; for after listening breathlessly,
with heads stooped low, we became assured that
there was no sound in the night air, but the sighing
of the wind through the olive and orange groves, and
the murmur of the Propontis as it broke on the silent
shore.
</p>

<p>
We were progressing in the direction of Heraclea,
where Major Catanagh lay with the rest of our
comrades and the regiment of the Mir Alai Saïd.  Callum
urged that we should lose no time in repairing there,
and insuring our own safety; but I was more intent
on reaching Rodosdchig, where I could draw off
my little party, embark them in boats, and sail for
the opposite Isle of Marmora, as I had now no
thought in this world but to save or rescue Sir
Horace and his friends from the danger that menaced
them.
</p>

<p>
'But if our detachment has been recalled from
Rodosdchig?' said Callum; 'what then?&mdash;we have
been absent several weeks, I think, though I forgot
to reckon the time in yonder atrocious den.'
</p>

<p>
I had not thought of this chance, and it puzzled
me.
</p>

<p>
Major Catanagh, may have been ordered to join
at head-quarters, for all that we know to the
contrary, sir, and may have marched for Constantinople,
said he.
</p>

<p>
Still my resolution was not altered.
</p>

<p>
'Let us reach Rodosdchig,' said I, doggedly.
</p>

<p>
The silent night wore away; pale Phosphorus,
the morning star of the old Greeks, melted into the
rosy sky of sunrise, as the god of day ascended from
the distant Ægean sea, and tipped the hills and
castles of the Dardanelles with fire.  The waves of the
Propontis gleamed in gold, and rolled like liquid
light upon its fertile shores.  We found ourselves in
a lonely place, where the sea broke in surf on one
hand, and on the other lay a marshy waste, where
buzzards and vultures seemed the only living things,
with a few of those solemn-looking storks, which are
so often to be found perched on the roofs of Turkish
houses; or peeping out of nests of twigs and clay,
made under their eaves.
</p>

<p>
Day had now fully broken.  I concealed the
bayonet in my sleeve as a weapon of defence; but
threw the musket into the sea.  Then Callum and I
put our sorely-soiled uniforms into the best order,
and though the amount of hair which flourished
around our visages gave us rather a Crimean aspect,
it mattered not in Turkey, and we stepped forward
with growing confidence, looking about for some one
to direct us, as the dome and minarets of a mosque
(like a punch-bowl between two champagne bottles)
appeared at a distance, and indicated the vicinity of
a town.
</p>

<p>
Near a well on the wayside, we found an old
woman, of an aspect rather Ghoulish, with her eyes
shining through the holes in her yashmack, which
was carefully drawn over her head, though her
poor mammary region was bare and flat as a
drumhead.  She was filling a vase of most classical
aspect, with the pure water of the circular well,
over which drooped the long branches of a solitary
date-palm.
</p>

<p>
On my inquiring the name of the little town which
was now visible above the orange-groves, she hastily
flung down her pitcher in great alarm, and muttering
something about 'Franks and Giaours,' fled from us.
</p>

<p>
'The devil's in the cailloch,' said Callum; 'does
she take us for ogres?'
</p>

<p>
Rather discouraged by the impression our appearance
seemed to make, we pressed on towards the town,
beyond which we saw a chain of snow-capped hills,
sparkling in the sunshine like cones of polished
silver.  We studied our plans and distances over and
over again; and I shuddered as I thought of the
hopeless captivity that might succeed our
recapture&mdash;the danger that hung over the Everinghams&mdash;the
dreadful Bagnio; and with that recollection there
came before me in fancy the careworn smile of
poor Achmet Effendi, and his miserable comrade
the lieutenant of artillery, who were still lingering
there.
</p>

<p>
I knew well the danger and the difficulty attending
two unarmed strangers travelling on foot in such a
country as Turkey; for at the present hour I need
scarcely remind the reader that even in the streets
of Stamboul, notwithstanding the presence of regular
troops and patrols of armed police, robberies and
assassinations of every description, by the handjiar, the
pistol, the bludgeon, and strangulation, are of
constant occurrence in open day.  If such is the case in
the capital of 'the Lord of the Black and White Seas,
and Keeper of the Holy Cities of Mecca, Medina, and
Jerusalem,' our prospects in his rural districts were
not very encouraging.
</p>

<p>
By the side of a rivulet we found a dreamy Osmanli
reclining under an orange-tree, regaling himself
on dates and cold water, with a paper cigar in his
mouth.  He was basking in the sunshine, and
believing himself, perhaps, in the Garden of Delights,
though minus the river of fragrant wine, the fruits
of the giant Toaba, and the caresses of the black-eyed
girls, with their limbs of snow, and scanty
cymars of green.
</p>

<p>
With the usual greeting, I inquired if he knew the
town now before us.
</p>

<p>
He replied in the affirmative; but the name I
cannot now remember, and no map that I have seen
bears it.
</p>

<p>
'Whence come you?' he inquired.
</p>

<p>
'Frangistan.'
</p>

<p>
'That I can perceive&mdash;but how?'
</p>

<p>
'By a ship.'
</p>

<p>
'Allah Kebir!  I did not expect you to fly.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course not&mdash;she was wrecked upon the coast.'
</p>

<p>
'And you escaped?'
</p>

<p>
'Narrowly, as you may see&mdash;all we possess is upon
us, and we are almost famished.'
</p>

<p>
'Bismillah! now I remember having smoked pipe
with you once.'
</p>

<p>
'Where, Aga?'
</p>

<p>
'In the khan at Heraclea.'
</p>

<p>
'I think I remember you,' said I; though in
truth I had no recollection of the worthy man
whatever.
</p>

<p>
'I have some dates and the spring-water here;
but you are welcome to both.  Eat with me, and we
shall be friends.  I am no Aga, but a humble dealer
in cherry-sticks, and having sold all my stock in
Selyvria, am now returning home.'
</p>

<p>
'To yonder town?'
</p>

<p>
'Exactly.'
</p>

<p>
'Has it a Kadi?
</p>

<p>
'Yes, and none in Roumelia knoweth better the
hundred and fourteen chapters of the Koran.  Whenever
his carpet is spread, heels are turned up and
heads sliced off in a twinkling!  Wallah! he knows
the law well, Hadjee Sohail Ebn Amru; and more
than all, he is my elder brother, and has built for the
public use a mosque and fountain, surrounded by
cypresses and mulberry-trees.  I had the misfortune
to come into existence a little later than he, so our
father left him every asper he had in the world: thus
the Kadi Sohail is a rich dealer in shawls, silks, and
carpets, while I am a poor vender of cherry-sticks;
but what seek you of the Kadi?'
</p>

<p>
'Not money, my friend.'
</p>

<p>
'You are wise&mdash;what then?'
</p>

<p>
'Horses to take us to Stamboul.'
</p>

<p>
'But who will pay for them?'
</p>

<p>
'Our ambassador.'
</p>

<p>
'Wallah!' replied the pipe-stick vender; 'all the
world say he is breaking his heart about the fall of
Kara; but all the world are liars, I think.  However,
as you came to fight for the Faithful, horses
you shall have, if my brother the Kadi can find
them.'
</p>

<p>
The acquaintance of this garrulous fellow was
quite a boon to us; and encouraged by his free and
talkative manner, and not a little amused by the airs
of patronage and protection he assumed, we stepped
boldly into the town, giving out, on all hands, that
we required horses for Stamboul.
</p>

<p>
I found that these Turks were fast making me as
sly and reserved as themselves.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap55"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LV.
<br /><br />
RESUME MY COMMAND.
</h3>

<p>
Assisted by our new friend, we reached the house and
bazaar of the Kadi Sohail Ebn Amru, who, on
our uniforms, and hearing that we required two horses
for the Sultan's service, after wonderfully little delay,
ordered that they should be procured, <i>i.e.</i>, taken, or
forcibly pressed, from the first or nearest persons
who were not included in the circle of his acquaintance.
While the nags were being brought, the seller
of pipe-sticks bustled about, and set before us a
repast of mutton-ham, cheese, white bread, and
Kirkissa wine, and we seated ourselves on some of those
soft carpets of Irann, which are the pride of the
Stambouli housewives.
</p>

<p>
The Kadi was not present, being closeted in an
inner apartment with a stranger, a brother Hadjee,
whom he appeared to treat with great reverence.
Ere long he came out, and invited us to enter and
'partake of coffee with his friend, who had travelled
a long way on foot and was weary.'
</p>

<p>
'A friend?' said I, hesitating.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Aga.'
</p>

<p>
'A soldier?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;a Moolah.'
</p>

<p>
'But a Moolah may not like us.'
</p>

<p>
'He is sure to do so.'
</p>

<p>
'But then we are soldiers,' I continued, still
hesitating; 'and Moolahs hate all soldiers.'
</p>

<p>
'Mashallah!' said the Kadi; ''tis the famous Hadjee
Moustapha, who has himself been a soldier, and
a brave one too.'
</p>

<p>
We were both confounded by lighting on this
devil of a Moolah even here!  I scarcely dared now
to whisper our danger to Callum, lest the visitor
might overhear, as a partition formed of striped cloth,
covered with sentences from the Koran alone separated
us; and if discovered by him, all the wealth
of Karoon (Crœsus) could not save us.  While
pondering what excuse to make, and finding that the
more I pondered the more obstinate my invention
became, luckily the horses&mdash;two fine Arabs&mdash;ready
accoutred, with high demi-pique saddles, and having
bridles and cruppers covered with brass knobs and
long red tassels, were led up by grooms wearing
each a red fez and voluminous blue breeches; then
bidding the Kadi and his brother farewell, and
hastily leaving a receipt and order on the regimental
paymaster for the alleged value of the horses, if not
safely returned, we trotted 'away,' as we said, 'for
Stamboul;' and then, from the street corner, started
at full gallop for Bodosdchig.
</p>

<p>
The town we left was garrisoned by two battalions
of the Egyptian contingent, consisting entirely of
<i>one-eyed men</i>.  So great is the horror of military service
in the land of Pharaoh in this age of steam, that the
people mutilate themselves in such numbers to avoid
soldiering, that the Pasha has been compelled to
enrol those having right eyes in one regiment, and
those having left eyes in another.
</p>

<p>
We rode at great speed, and when the sun was
verging towards the long chain of the Tekir mountains,
we saw before us the crenelated walls, the old
castle, the flat roofs, the gilded mosques and white
minars of Bodosdchig, with the tall, solemn cypresses,
and the green City of the Silent, where I had first
met Iola; and there lay the ruined hermitage of
St. Basil amid its beautiful groves, and the Holy Well
still sparkling in the setting sunshine.  My heart
filled with tender memories, and I shuddered when I
saw her dreadful grave&mdash;the waves of the blue
Propontis&mdash;gleaming far beyond the landscape; but I
thrust away such thoughts, and gnawing my nether
lip, strove to think only of Laura and the desperate
task I had before me.
</p>

<p>
Laura and Iola!
</p>

<p>
The struggle is a sore one, when there is but <i>one</i>
heart for <i>two</i> loves!
</p>

<p>
As we approached the castle, all heedless of the
clamour excited among the usually inert and sullen
Turks by our appearance when galloping through
the muddy streets, Callum uttered a shout of
satisfaction on seeing the red coat, the green tartans,
and glittering bayonet of a Highland sentinel at the
castle gate.
</p>

<p>
'Now God and Mary be thanked, our men are here
yet!' exclaimed he, in Gaelic.
</p>

<p>
As we rode in, our comrades hurried forth to meet
us, and in a trice we had Serjeant Mac Ildhui,
Corporal Donald Roy, and every man of my little
detachment around us with clamorous tongues, and hands
outstretched in joyous congratulation, with many an
inquiry, while the Turkish guard of Topchis looked
on with a sullen and dogged stare from under their
bushy eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
Roused by their clamour, an officer in a scarlet
jacket and tartan trews, with a Turkish fez, a bearded
chin, and a meerschaum in his mouth, jumped over a
window on the ground-floor, and joined the group in
the castle-yard.
</p>

<p>
'Mac Innon&mdash;Allan Mac Innon!' he exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'Jack Belton!'
</p>

<p>
We shook hands warmly as I dismounted.
</p>

<p>
'By all the powers, where have you been?  In the
hands of the evil genii?'
</p>

<p>
'Where I cannot tell you, at present.'
</p>

<p>
'We all feared you had bid farewell&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'To what?'
</p>

<p>
'The great scuffle of life.'
</p>

<p>
'Not at all&mdash;but how came you here?'
</p>

<p>
'To take command of your detachment, when
Serjeant Mac Ildhui reported your lamentable demise,
and we had the big drum covered respectably up
with crape, and funeral knots tied on our
sword-hilts.  We are to march to-morrow, so had you
been a few hours later, we had been off for Stamboul.'
</p>

<p>
'Fortunate!' said I, with a glance at Callum; 'but
you must delay your march a little time, Jack.
I have a small expedition cut out for you&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Of a warlike nature?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'And I have some news for <i>you</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!'
</p>

<p>
'We are both gazetted Lieutenants, <i>vice</i> Cameron
and Moray, dead&mdash;one of wounds at Sebastopol, the
other of cholera at Scutari&mdash;poor fellows!  So we
have two commissions to wet&mdash;I, yours&mdash;and you,
mine.  I have another box of cheroots and some
prime Cavendish, with a jar of Kirkissa wine.  Come
along&mdash;I'll hear all your news in my room&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'And the Yuze Bashi&mdash;how is he?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, a most unamiable old fellow&mdash;in the sick-list
still, having been powdered and pilled by a Jew
Hakim, till he cannot move.'
</p>

<p>
'Long may he remain so!' said I, revengefully, as
we entered Jack's quarters.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes I had refreshed myself, changed
my attire, anil sat down to such a repast as Jack's
servant could prepare in haste; we lighted our
cigars; Jack drank his wine out of a tumbler, and
I mine out of a cream-jug, as our utensils were
meanly and in a dilapidated condition.  Jack smoked
in silence and patience, waiting to hear a story which
I knew not how to begin, as I was loth&mdash;exceedingly
loth&mdash;to account for that remarkable cruise
undertaken by Callum and me at night; so there was a
long silence, during which Jack whiffed away, and
then he stared inquiringly at me.
</p>

<p>
'You sigh?' said he; 'what the deuce is the matter?
Fill your cup with wine again&mdash;and drink, my
boy.  Remember the mess-room song&mdash;
</p>

<p>
  'Since the chief end of life is to live and be jolly,<br />
  To be sad about trifles is trifling and folly.'<br />
</p>

<p>
<i>En avant</i>!  What have you been about, Allan?  We
heard that you had been making love to a Haidee&mdash;a
flower of "the Isles of Greece," or some Turkish
odalisque&mdash;but you lost her?  Never mind, my boy&mdash;she'll
soon prove, "though lost to sight, to memory
<i>queer</i>," when we change quarters.'
</p>

<p>
I quieted Jack's raillery by a grave relation of my
adventures; and his wonder, anger, and resentment
were excited alternately by the horrors I had undergone,
and by the heartless assassination of poor
Clavering; but the moment I mentioned the danger of
the yacht, he started to his feet, exclaiming&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'O hang it! this can never be permitted!  We
can't march for Heraclea to-morrow.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course not, with this devilish business on the
tapis.'
</p>

<p>
'It is our duty&mdash;our bounden duty&mdash;to march
at once with every man we have, and to save Sir
Horace and his people from these butcherly Mohammedans.'
</p>

<p>
'March?&mdash;sail you mean!' said I.
</p>

<p>
'And we must get a craft to-night&mdash;it is not yet
too late,' he exclaimed, looking at his watch.
</p>

<p>
'Callum! call Serjeant Mac Ildhui&mdash;our lads
must all be in marching order, with haversacks and
ammunition, an hour before daylight to-morrow.'
</p>

<p>
'Very well, sir.'
</p>

<p>
'Bravo!' added Jack; 'we shall cut a dash, and
have a little war on our own account.'
</p>

<p>
'An entire column in the "Times" to ourselves.'
</p>

<p>
'And a sketch in the "Illustrated News," of course.'
</p>

<p>
'There go the pipes for tattoo&mdash;fill your wine-horn
again, Allan!  Here's success to our expedition in
the morning!'
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap56"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LVI.
<br /><br />
'BIODH TREUN!'
</h3>

<p>
The morning was cold and frosty, though in the last
days of February.  The sun was yet below the horizon;
but all the sea that stretched away towards the
mouth of the Bosphorus on one hand, and the
Dardanelles on the other, was covered by a golden
brilliance; and a rosy gleam in the east indicated the
quarter from which, without any lingering twilight,
he would climb at once the azure sky.  No cloud
shaded the surface of the latter, and scarcely a ripple
seemed to curl the still and beautiful bosom of the
Propontis.
</p>

<p>
Callum brought me my only heir-loom, the old
claymore, on the blade of which my father&mdash;in some
old Flemish camp, when serving under York&mdash;had
written the two words, <i>Biodh Treun</i> (be valiant).
I stuck my revolver and dirk in my belt, and
descended to the parade-ground full of enthusiasm
and hope.
</p>

<p>
My little band of Highlanders mustered in the
chill morning with alacrity.  They were all in light
marching order, and in addition to their arms and
accoutrements, carried only their greatcoats and
wooden canteens.  I carefully inspected their
ammunition, and then marched them to the landing-place,
where a large kochamba, which had been procured
overnight, and which was manned by eight stout
galiondgis, awaited us.  Before marching out, I had
no little difficulty in explaining to the Yuze Bashi's
second in command the nature of the expedition on
which we were departing, and that we must necessarily
return for our baggage, knapsacks, and squad-bags,
before marching to Heraclea.  To the Major I
despatched a mounted Topchi, with a letter acquainting
him with my return to my party, my late adventures,
and the nature of the service on which I had
gone&mdash;a service of which I was convinced he would
approve, as the necessary protection of British
subjects had forced me upon it, and as there was no
vessel of war near with which I could communicate,
and, save my Highlanders, no other armed force on
which I could rely.
</p>

<p>
Of these Highlanders, whose task was now to save
Sir Horace from the pirates, <i>eight</i> were evicted Mac
Innons of Glen Ora; and in the ranks I heard them
recalling to each other the day 'when the glen was
desolated,' as we marched from the castle with our
pipe playing, and embarked in the kochamba; then
we shipped eight long sweeps, with two men to
each, hoisted the long and tapering lateen sail, and
stood out of the harbour of Rodosdchig, with a fair
wind that bore us away southward for the Isle of
Marmora.
</p>

<p>
As we put to sea, Callum urged me in a whisper
to have the boat's head shot first to starboard&mdash;'<i>the
deisuil</i>,' as he said, 'in honour of the sun'&mdash;an old
superstitious custom, for which, like many others, he
was a great stickler; and as I had the tiller-ropes, it
was at once complied with.
</p>

<p>
My fellows were all lively and merry at the
prospect of a brush with any one; and this duty seemed
a stirring change after the dull monotony of mounting
guard in that old castle, whose shadow fell far
across the shining water, and where their only
companions were the stolid, opium-drugged, big-breeched,
raki-drinking, and chibouque-smoking Topchis of the
Yuze Bashi Hussein.
</p>

<p>
With their broad chests heaving, and their bearded
faces flushed by exertion as they bent to their task,
Callum Dhu, Donald Roy, and Serjeant Mac Ildhui
sang an old Highland boat-song, to which the rowers
kept time with their broad-bladed sweeps, that flashed
like fire as they threw the silver spray towards the
rising sun&mdash;the glorious sun of Asia, which filled all
that morning sea with his dazzling splendour&mdash;and
while the piper played in the prow, all the soldiers
joined in parts, their thirty voices making the sky
ring when they united in one volume, to the astonishment
of the immovable Turks, and to the great amusement
of Jack Belton, who enjoyed our enthusiasm,
but laughed like a Lowlander at the strange words
of the chorus, which suited the action of the oars,
and were somewhat to the following purpose:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  '<i>Horo, horo, horo elé,<br />
  Horo, horo, horo elé;<br />
  Hu ho i o 'sna ho elé,</i>' &amp;c.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Well, 'pon my soul,' said Jack, as he lolled in the
stern-sheets of the boat, polishing the barrel of a
finished Colt with the ashes of his cheroot, 'this is
better fun than blowing on the flute, or pumping on
an accordion all day long in one's barrack-room for
lack of something to do.'
</p>

<p>
'Wait,' said I, 'until you have seen Fanny Clavering;
your mind will then be fully occupied.'
</p>

<p>
'By love for her?'
</p>

<p>
'Of course.'
</p>

<p>
'Query&mdash;is she beautiful?'
</p>

<p>
'I don't think Heaven ever created another so
brilliant and so fascinating.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed! you quite interest me.  The deuce!  I
shall be in danger of losing both life and liberty;
but I don't mean to wed in a hurry.'
</p>

<p>
'Fanny has a handsome fortune&mdash;she is rich.'
</p>

<p>
'Money is nothing to a sub of a year or two's
standing.'
</p>

<p>
'True&mdash;but we may remain jolly subs long enough
now.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't think of it, pray&mdash;but alas! peace will soon be
proclaimed now, as we have polished off the imperial
boots of His Majesty of Russia, and all the additional
battalions must be reduced.'
</p>

<p>
'Fanny's bright hazel eyes&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Will not lure me into matrimony, pin-money, and
baby-jumpers.  I mean not to think of such things until
I require cotton caps, water-gruel, and hot bottles at
night; until I give up the polka, relinquish my pipe,
and vote the mistletoe a most improper appendage to a
Christmas chandelier; when I consider music a bore,
and babies <i>not</i> a bother; when I deem flirtation
disgraceful, and prefer a quiet game at crown-points to
whirling with Maria or Louisa in the <i>deux temps</i>&mdash;I
shall think of it seriously, and prepare to take
upon my knee a little Jack Belton, and sing "Ride
a cock horse to Bambury Cross," or of old "Humpty
Dumpty who sat on a wall," and so forth.'
</p>

<p>
While Jack ran on thus, Callum Dhu, who sat near
me with his belt and jacket off, pulling the stroke oar,
was listening to him with a quiet smile, for he liked
his rattling, off-hand manner.
</p>

<p>
'Callum,' said I, '<i>you</i> remember Miss Clavering?'
</p>

<p>
'Many a time, sir, I have led her pony up Ben
Ora, and round the Craig-na-tuirc!  Who that ever
saw her could forget her?' he replied, as his eye
sparkled and his cheek flushed, while he gave fresh
energy to tugging at the bending sweep; 'She was
ever so gay, so beautiful, so joyous and flattering!'
</p>

<p>
'And Miss Everingham, too,' I added, in a low
voice; 'Mrs. Clavering, I should say.'
</p>

<p>
Callum gave me a glance full of deep and sorrowful
meaning; but he only bit his proud nether lip,
and bent more lustily to the oar.  He was as full
of ardour at the prospect of risking his life in defence
of these two ladies as if he was the accepted lover of
them both; for poor Callum's heart was chivalrous as
it was kind and true; and though, like himself, more
than one soldier in that huge lumbering boat had
good reason to curse the intrusive name of
Everingham, and that feudal law which enabled a landlord
to evict the people, they were all ready to face fire
and water, shot and steel, to rescue him and his
friends from the perils that surrounded them.  Fresh
hands were laid on the oars; the sun attained its
meridian height; the outlines of the Isle of Marmora
began to rise higher to the southward; sturdily
pulled the Highland oarsmen, and still their strange
wild chorus was wafted to leeward on the Grecian
sea&mdash;
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER LVII.
<br /><br />
THE ISLE OF MARMORA.
</h3>

<p>
I gazed alternately on the distant island that was now
rising faint and blue from the shining sea, and on the
huge lateen sail that tapered far away aloft upon its
slender yard, which resembled a fishing-rod, while
Belton still lounged in the stern-sheets, and lunched
on sliced Bologna sausages, biscuits, and sherry.
</p>

<p>
'Yonder Isle of Marmora has some interest for
me,' said he; 'I had an uncle who got his wife out
of that identical place.'
</p>

<p>
'From the marble quarries, perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'Not at all&mdash;he was no Pygmalion.  He was
first-lieutenant in the flagship here, about ten years ago,
and being in hopeless ill health, was landed, with six
months' leave to remain at the house of an Armenian
merchant, who treated him with great kindness, and
whose daughter&mdash;young and lovely, of course&mdash;nursed
him with the most enchanting tenderness.
So whether it was owing to the fresh breezes from
the Propontis, the cool wines of old Greece, or the
charms of the soft maid of Armenia, I know not;
but before the six months were up, mine uncle
reported himself to the Admiral as "fit for duty,"
and joined his ship.  He thought very sadly about
his Armenian for a time, and felt very restless in
his cot at night; but soon dismissed her from
his thoughts, as the ship had to be painted and
overhauled, and sent home to Portsmouth.  A
year after he was with our fleet at Stamboul, and
while rambling there with a brother captain&mdash;for he
had his own frigate then&mdash;they entered the
slave-market in disguise.  There he saw&mdash;what?&mdash;his
beautiful Armenian friend&mdash;his kind little nurse&mdash;the
daughter of his hospitable entertainer&mdash;offered
for sale as a slave!  She knew him, and in tears and
agony stretched her pretty hands towards him; for
she was a Christian woman, and felt keenly all the
horrors of her situation.  Her story was soon told.
Her father's ships had perished at sea; his wealth
had passed away; he died, and his Turkish creditors
had remorselessly seized everything, even to the
carpet his daughter sat on.  Then they seized her
too, and offered her for sale&mdash;and there she stood,
with a ticket on her breast, and her price marked
thereon.
</p>

<p>
'For sale!  My uncle was an honest fellow&mdash;he
damned their eyes all round, and swore he felt it
in his heart to flog one-half Stamboul and keelhaul
the other.  An Unbeliever cannot purchase women;
but my uncle knew a Turkish officer, who was an
Irishman&mdash;Bim Bashi O'Toole&mdash;who, for a dozen of
wine, undertook to manage the affair; so for four
hundred guineas he bought the fair Armenian, and
married her at the ambassador's chapel.  Then he
brought her home in his own frigate.  He is now
posted, a C.B., on half-pay, and resides with his
Armenian wife, and six little half-Scotch, half-Armenian
imps, in one of the prettiest villages in Strathearn;
so you see, Mac Innon, this classic island of Marmora
has quite a family interest for me.'
</p>

<p>
While Jack ran on in this fashion, I was wholly
occupied in thinking of two soft eyes, and a certain
fair, pale, English face, with its chestnut braids and
rosy lips, and of a low sweet voice, that seemed
already whispering in my ear&mdash;the voice of Laura,
whose tones had come to me so often in the dreams
of night.  In imagination I again beheld her, and
that peculiar <i>individuality</i> which indicates every one
by habit, gesture, form, and smile, came all before
me in one gush of memory.
</p>

<p>
The nut-brown sail, with its broad, black stripes,
bellied out in the light wind that played over the
ripples of the noonday sea, but ere long the wind
grew light, and as it died away, the sail flapped
heavily and the kochamba lurched and rolled upon
the glassy swell.
</p>

<p>
The day drew on, and soon the rosy tints of sunset
lingered on the shore, bathing with a ruby gleam
each wooded bay and rocky cape that stretched into
the dim and azure haze, far, far away.  The coast of
Roumelia seemed all of sapphire hue; the little Isle
of Coudouri beamed from the blue sea like a huge
amethyst sparkling with diamonds&mdash;these were the
casements of its little town, that were glittering in
the western light.
</p>

<p>
The Isle of Marmora now looked close and high,
and I sighed for the lagging wind, as we lay becalmed
about four miles off its western promontory,
and one mile due east of Coudouri, with the sea
darkening fast around us, and the stars coming out one
by one from the sky of brilliant amber.
</p>

<p>
While we continued to scan the coast with our telescopes,
as it was in this part of the Isle the yacht was
ashore, Jack Belton discovered the masts and hull of
a smart schooner, which lay pretty high up in one of
the sandy bays that now opened upon our view; and
this we had no doubt was the craft we were in quest
of, as the position in which she lay, and her
appearance, exactly corresponded to what we had heard of
the <i>Fairy Bell</i>, Sir Horace's vessel.  Being somewhat
tired by the exertions of the past day, my soldiers
and the galiondgis had relinquished their oars, and
sat gazing dreamily either at the glassy water or the
little black speck which indicated the hull of the
yacht ashore.
</p>

<p>
'Suppose the islanders were to rise upon us, and
assist these Oriental ticket-of-leavers!' said Belton.
</p>

<p>
'You are most unpleasantly suggestive,' said I;
'but let them rise, they are welcome.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.  With thirty Highlandmen, I would not fear
to face three hundred Greeks.'
</p>

<p>
'Even those of Leonidas?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Jack&mdash;even those of Leonidas!'
</p>

<p>
'Bravo!&mdash;but this may prove more than a mere
melo-dramatic performance.'
</p>

<p>
'It may&mdash;but ha!&mdash;what is that?' I exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
'A gun&mdash;a flash on the shore!'
</p>

<p>
'Another!'
</p>

<p>
'And another!'
</p>

<p>
'Now, heavens above, what may this mean?'
</p>

<p>
'The pirates.'
</p>

<p>
'The pirates already!'
</p>

<p>
'We have been anticipated by the four caiques!'
cried several voices.
</p>

<p>
'Out with the sweeps and oars!&mdash;down with the
mast and yard!&mdash;in with the sail!' I commanded,
with excited energy, and the orders were obeyed
with alacrity.
</p>

<p>
'Clap on to the sweeps now!'
</p>

<p>
'Give way, my boys&mdash;give way with a will!' said Belton.
</p>

<p>
Flash after flash came rapidly and redly from the
dark and wooded bay; the boom of carronades pealed
over the water, and then came the patter of small
arms.
</p>

<p>
My soul was full of anxiety; I panted rather than
breathed, for I was without a doubt that we had
been anticipated&mdash;that those wretches had commenced
their attack, and that Sir Horace was fighting
gallantly, like a brave English gentleman.
</p>

<p>
'But see,' said Callum, to whom I had freely
communicated all my fears, 'there are three or four
vessels now rounding the promontory and entering
the bay, for good or for evil?'
</p>

<p>
'The telescope, Jack&mdash;the telescope, for God's
sake!&mdash;thank you,' said I, adjusting it for a night
observation, as the darkness had now almost set in;
but I could distinctly perceive four long, low, and
sharply-built caiques, full of men, many of whom
appeared to be armed with muskets, pulled swiftly
round a black promontory of rock which jutted into
that sea of amber, and each in succession shot swiftly
into the wooded bay.
</p>

<p>
Several brilliant rockets now hissed upward into
the blue sky; and as their sparkles descended in a
shower among the woods, or on the rippled water
all became dark and still&mdash;so deathly still, that I
heard only the beating of my heart, and the
half-suppressed breathing of the rowers, three of whom
were bending on every sweep, and the splashing of
the water, as we neared the eastern headland of the
little bay in which the yacht was beached, and into
which these dark and mysterious craft had glided so
noiselessly.

<h3>
CHAPTER LVIII.
<br /><br />
THE FAIRY BELL.
</h3>

<p>
The Island of Marmora&mdash;the Elephonesos of the
ancients&mdash;is a dependency of an Anatolian Sanjiack,
and lies sixty miles south-west of Stamboul.  It is
about ten miles long, and has a miserable little town
of romantic-looking wigwams on its southern coast,
and a Turkish pharos on a promontory towards the
Bosphorus.  Of old, it was famous for its marble
quarries, but now is noted only for sterility, and its
meagre population of bare-footed and blue-breeched
Greek fishermen.
</p>

<p>
The bay, however, which we were now stealthily
entering, was richly wooded; but many of the trees
were bare, for the black gusts of the last autumn
had swept both sea and shore; but there the wild
almond was wont to shed its silver blossoms in
spring, and even now, the wild thyme, the caper-shrub,
the rose-laurel, the woodbine, and the china-rose,
made all the inlet beautiful; nor were the scarlet
lotus, or the graceful date-palm, which an
Oriental poet likens to a young beauty bending her
head; or the soft perfume of the sweet El-caya tree
of Yemen, wanting to complete the charm of this
dark and shady cove.  Softly we stole in, with
handkerchiefs tied round our sweeps to muffle them; and
while we pulled swiftly, keeping close in shore, and
under the deep shadow thrown by the woods upon
the starlit water, we carefully loaded and capped our
fire-arms, all of which were fortunately Minie rifles,
as my detachment belonged to the Light Company.
</p>

<p>
Now at the end of the bay the moon rose broad
and full, and as her giant disc heaved up in all its
bright effulgence from the shining sea, a column of
light flashed from the horizon into the wooded creek,
and displayed its sylvan scenery.
</p>

<p>
We could see the yacht&mdash;the <i>Fairy Bell</i>&mdash;as she
lay in the shallow water careened to port; she was
tautly rigged; her foremast was strong; her
mainmast tall, and tapering away aloft like the finest
willow wand.  Her hull was long and low; her
breadth of beam was great, and the copper on her
sharp bows shone like burnished gold in the
moonlight; her decks were flush, level, and had twelve
carronades&mdash;all of which, however, were quite
useless, by the elevation of their muzzles on one side,
and the consequent depression on the other; and
I saw at a glance that, unless vigorously defended,
this smart little yacht, the flower of Cowes, the pink
of the Channel squadron, and the winner of five
silver cups which adorned the library at Elton Hall,
would fall a prey to these piratical caiques.
</p>

<p>
We were all nearing her rapidly; but fortunately
the dark shadow of the wooded shore completely
veiled the kochamba, while the caiques were fully
visible in the blaze of a moonlight that filled the
bay.  A half-shout, half-cheer, from the crew of the
yacht&mdash;now distant from us about five hundred
yards&mdash;announced that her people were on the alert.
Then a garland of fire zoned her low black gunwale
round, as a volley of fire-arms was poured upon the
approaching boats, and crashed through their planking.
</p>

<p>
'Hurrah!' cried Jack Belton; 'the old M.P. is
quite up to the mark, I think!'
</p>

<p>
'Keep close in&mdash;keep in the shadow,' said I; 'or,
by Jove! we may come in for a dose of that, too,
before they know who we are.'
</p>

<p>
'That fire was well directed,' said Callum.
</p>

<p>
'It has staggered those devils in the boats&mdash;I see
them throwing aside their oars,' added Jack.
</p>

<p>
'Stretch out&mdash;stretch out!' I exclaimed, drawing
my sword; 'and be ready, every man of yous to fire
the moment I give the word!'
</p>

<p>
It was most unfortunate for the yacht that her guns
were rendered useless by her heel to port; but the
fire of her small-arms was brisk; and a yell replied,
as the caiques, which had been warily pulled in a line
duly astern of her, now dashed upon her quarters,
and a vigorous attempt was made by the Turks to
board.  In the moonlight we could see the momentary
gleam of sabres as they were brandished, and of
bayonets as they were pointed; the flashing of
pistols, and the appearance of dark faces and darker
figures, as they strove to gain a footing on the
side-chains, and to force a passage, by fighting, to the
schooner's deck, but were thrust over by the bayonet
or beaten down by the clubbed musket; and were
dashed, wounded and bleeding, into the sandy and
blood-stained water, which took them up to the girdle,
or little above it.  With all their efforts, it was
evident the yachts-men would have the worst of it
ere long, for some of the Greek villains had just forced
a passage to the deck, when one more stroke of the
sweeps brought us within sure range.
</p>

<p>
'Now, Highlanders,' cried I, 'ready!&mdash;present!&mdash;you
can pick off these fellows like a covey of partridges.'
</p>

<p>
'Or sparrows on a midden,' added Callum, as
thirty Minie rifles, levelled low, were fired out of the
gloomy shade, and thirty spherical rifled bullets
whistled among the dark crowd which filled the
caiques.
</p>

<p>
'Keep up your fire, my lads,' cried I, 'and give
way&mdash;stretch out!' I added to the galiondgis; 'close
up&mdash;let us only come hand to hand with them; pull
right across the stern of the yacht, and rake the boats
alongside.'
</p>

<p>
This enabled us to sweep the caiques on both sides
of her; and my men kept up a brisk fire.  As they
had sixty rounds each, there was no danger of their
running short of ammunition.  Yells of fear and
rage were now blended with those of pain, and the
water was full of dead and wounded wretches, from
among whom some forty or fifty of the survivors
were frantically endeavouring to escape; and to the
astonishment of the yachts-men, who were totally
unable to comprehend from what quarter this
unexpected succour had come, the attack was abandoned
with precipitation; and two of the caiques were
pulled rapidly away, while the others floated alongside,
deserted by their crews; for all who were not
lying dead on the thwarts, or struggling with wounds
and broken limbs in the water, had scrambled ashore
and fled.
</p>

<p>
The attack had been made by not less than sixty
outlaws&mdash;all savage-looking Suliotes, half-black
Natolians, wild Arabs, and Candiote mariners.  Of these
nearly twenty had been sent to their last account;
but the affair was not over yet.
</p>

<p>
Four or five had fought their way on board the
yacht; but when our fire had swept the water alongside,
they all sprang overboard, save one, who concealed
himself in one of the quarter-boats, at the
moment we boarded the schooner.
</p>

<p>
As I ascended the side, a strange-looking personage,
clad in a light-blue uniform jacket minus tails, a
pair of checked Tweed trousers, and wearing a
cavalry helmet of unique form, appeared to welcome us.
He was armed with a large sabre, and though his
upper lip had been put on the war establishment, and
wore a grisly moustache&mdash;and though the costume he
had so hastily donned was partly the uniform of the
South Pedlington Yeomanry, of which he was
Lieutenant-Colonel, I had no difficulty in recognising the
sleek round visage and well-curved paunch of old
Sir Horace Everingham, all breathless and blown,
and decidedly more 'out of sorts' than ever I had
seen him, when toiling up my Highland hills at
home.
</p>

<p>
'Never was aid more opportune, my dear sir,'
said he; 'from whence have you come with your
soldiers&mdash;from the clouds?  Awful business this&mdash;but
I expected it&mdash;I shall complain to our ambassador&mdash;those
d&mdash;&mdash;d ungrateful Greeks!  I shall address
the House on the subject&mdash;I will expose it in the
"Times" newspaper&mdash;I will, sir, by Heaven!'
</p>

<p>
Close by the baronet stood his <i>fidus Achates</i>, the
pale and affrighted Mr. Jeames Toodles, whom he
had barbarously forced to remain on deck, and who,
having no idea of how to handle any lethal weapon,
had spread before him an immense gig umbrella,
which loomed in his front like the shield of Achilles,
and which he had successfully held between him and
'the dark Suliotes,' whom he believed to be nothing
else than veritable Bashi Bozooks, of whom he had
seen some appalling sketches in the 'Illustrated
London News.'
</p>

<p>
Several of the fugitives, from among the dark foliage
on shore, were now firing with their muskets and
pistols, and had wounded some of us.  We pulled
vigorously towards the beach, and opened a random
fire of musketry upon those lurkers in the jungle;
but now there came a shrill cry from the deck of the
yacht.  I looked back, and for a moment saw the
light dress of a lady flutter in the moonlight&mdash;and
then there was a heavy splash in the water alongside,
as she was flung overboard.
</p>

<p>
It was Fanny Clavering, who, impelled by an
irresistible curiosity, had peeped on deck, and had at
that instant been seized and tossed over the gunwale
by the pirate who was concealed in the quarter-boat.
</p>

<p>
This pirate was Zahroun, the galiondgi, the wretch
whom I had left in the Bagnio, but who had escaped
from thence, heaven alone knows how (unless aided
by Clavering's ring), to share in the horrors of this
night attack, which he had so carefully and daringly
projected.
</p>

<p>
In another moment we saw this brawny villain
standing on the beach, with the light form of Fanny
in his arms (but I knew not that the girl was Fanny
then); and a sickly terror that she might be Laura
palsied every thought and energy.  At arms' length
he held her up triumphantly above him, and uttered
a cry of derision and defiance:
</p>

<p>
'Allah ho Ackbar!'&mdash;a cry, half-laugh, half-yell&mdash;as
he opposed her light and drooping figure to the
levelled muskets which we dared not discharge.  I
sprang into the water, with my claymore in one hand,
and a loaded revolver, with a single barrel but
having six chambers, in the other.  Yet I could not
fire a single shot for the same reason that withheld
the truer aims of Belton and our soldiers, lest the ball
might miss the vulture and hit the dove.  Callum
Dhu followed me close, with his rifle cocked; but as
we advanced from the water, up the sandy and
pebbled beach, Zahroun ran hurriedly inland, and
while we pursued, once, twice&mdash;ay thrice, the dark
wood was streaked with light, as pistols were fired
from the jungle at us, but happily missed.
</p>

<p>
Now on a little plateau of rock, in the full blaze of
the moonlight, the brawny and bandy-legged figure
of Zahroun appeared against the sky in dark and
strong outline.  He grasped his captive by her hair
with his left hand; she was on her knees beside him,
and with his right arm held aloft, he flourished a long
keen Turkish handjiar, which flashed with a blue
gleam, for it is a weapon deadly as the creese of a
Malay.
</p>

<p>
'Now, now, foster-brother!' cried I, to Callum
Dhu, in Gaelic, 'by God's love and your mother's
bones, fire true!'
</p>

<p>
He knelt down on one knee, and quick as thought
took aim; his keen and hawk-like eye glanced along
the smooth rifle-barrel&mdash;there was a flash&mdash;a sharp
report; the form of Zahroun wheeled frantically
round for a moment in the air, and then fell flat
beside his rescued prisoner.
</p>

<p>
'Dioul!' said Callum, as he coolly reloaded, and
cast about his musket; 'tha chried mi gu'n d'thoir
am fear ad tuille trioblaidh dhuinn!'  (The devil!  I
don't think yonder lout will trouble us more.)
</p>

<p>
But he was mistaken; for again the figure of
Zahreun staggered wildly up, and he fired a pistol at
random, and, in revenge, full at us.  I felt a sharp
twinge in my left side, as if a hot iron had seared me
suddenly.  I became giddy, and as I tottered, the dread
of leaving life and all the world entered my soul,
vividly and painfully.
</p>

<p>
'O Callum!' I exclaimed, and fell backward into
his arms; 'the villain has shot me!'
</p>

<p>
A volley rang in my ears as the Highlanders
poured all their shot and vengeance on Zahroun, who
fell prone to the turf, literally riddled by rifle-balls.
</p>

<p>
Callum's deadly aim, by bringing this savage down
and arresting his upraised knife, had averted a great
calamity, and saved the life of Fanny Clavering.
Another second had seen our terrified beauty laid at
the feet of the galiondgi a corpse.
</p>

<p>
Fanny knew and felt all she owed to Callum, for
she had seen him kneel and aim when others shrank
from the perilous task; and as he sprang lightly up
the rock, and tenderly raised her, she impulsively
threw herself with a burst of transport into his arms;
for in a moment she recognized her former acquaintance
and guide over the steep craigs and heath-clad
mountains of Glen Ora.
</p>

<p>
'Callum Dhu&mdash;Callum Mac Ian!' she exclaimed,
'and you it is who have saved me&mdash;oh Callum, how I
shall love you!'
</p>

<p>
The features of Callum were strongly marked, and
bore evidence of deep and bitter thoughts, and of
ready passions.  His eyes were keen, and, by turns,
fierce and thoughtful, sad, and winning.  His
bearing was soldier-like; his moustaches were smartly
trimmed; his eyebrows were thick and well defined.
Fanny, a constitutional coquette, brought all her
batteries to bear upon the handsome Highlander; and
the moment that her native spirit of fun and flirtation
replaced her terror of death, she would have no other
hand and no other arm than those of her 'preserver,
her dear, dear old friend Callum,' to conduct her to
the yacht, and assist her up the side on board.
</p>

<p>
There, too, I was conveyed in an almost inanimate
state; and the alarm for my safety was greatly
increased by the total absence of any medical
attendance.
</p>

<p>
I shall not describe the grief of honest Callum, or
the terror of Laura Everingham, who during the past
conflict had been seated, pale and in tears, in the
cabin of the yacht; nor her cry of anguish, on seeing
the poor young officer of the Highlanders, who had
come so miraculously to their aid, borne senseless and
bleeding into her father's cabin; nor shall I attempt
to detail her wild glance and speechless astonishment,
when the blunt baronet returned to tell her 'that this
unfortunate fellow was no other than Allan Mac
Innon, the son of old Glen Ora, the wild Highland boy
she had known at home!' * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
It was long before poor Laura could realize the
truth of this information, or the terrible tidings of
Clavering's death, which, after the hurly-burly was
over, she learned from Jack Belton and Callum Dhu
next morning.

CHAPTER LIX.
<br /><br />
A GLEAM OF OTHER DAYS.
</h3>

<p>
The firing which we had heard on coming in sight of
the yacht was caused by Sir Horace, who, to soothe
his impatience, had been discharging his carronades.
Moreover, from an old Greek pilot, who dwelt on the
little isle of Coudouri, he had received some hints,
that unless the yacht was speedily got to sea, she
might be attacked some night and plundered.
</p>

<p>
In this affair several of the yachts-men were killed,
and several severely wounded; but all the Highlanders
escaped, save Donald Roy, who had one of his bare
legs slashed by a yataghan; the son of old Ian Mac
Raonuil, who received a pistol-shot through the left
shoulder, and another lad from my glen, a son of
Alisdair Mac Gouran, who was bruised by a musket-butt;
but the surgeon of the <i>Mahmoudieh</i>, the Turkish
steamer, which came in a day or two after, and who
proved to be a clever Milanese, soon put all our cuts
and scars right, and pronounced me out of danger,
though two of my ribs were broken on the left side,
and I was weak as a child from over-excitement and
loss of blood.  His injunctions moreover were, that I
was not to be removed; but there was no chance of
that, while Laura and Fanny hovered like guardian
angels near my cabin-door, and while the burst of
gratitude that swelled the heart of Sir Horace, on
finding himself rescued by Her Majesty's troops, and
by my personal exertions, remained in his bosom&mdash;all
aristocratic, externally frigid, and exclusive as it was.
</p>

<p>
'Removed!' he reiterated, 'no, no&mdash;he shall make
my yacht his home&mdash;and every Highlander shall
make it his home.  They must remain on board till
the schooner returns to Constantinople (she had left
it three weeks ago, on her return to England), and I
will be accountable for them all to their commanding
officer.  I am an M.P., as well as a Lieutenant-Colonel&mdash;yes,
Lieutenant-Colonel of the gallant South
Peddlington Yeomanry, or Prince Alfred's Own
Carbineers, the terror of the mining districts.'
</p>

<p>
Jack Belton and Sergeant Mac Ildhui with twenty
men had a hunt&mdash;a regular stalking-match&mdash;over the
island for the fugitive pirates; but not one was to be
found; they had all vanished like the three hundred
and sixty idols of Mecca, when the prophet waved
his enchanted lance.  Then Jack conceiving that it
would be much more pleasant to proceed to Stamboul
in the yacht of Sir Horace, when there were two
charming young ladies on board, with the best of good
living, prime port, and 'no end' of pink champagne
and hermetically-sealed provisions, than to march on
foot from Rodosdchig to Heraclea, and from thence to
the Golden Horn, warmly seconded the baronet's
grateful invitation, and sent a despatch to Major
Catanagh, detailing Sir Horace's wish, and warmly
commending his zeal for Her Majesty's service.  He
also sent the pinnace of the Mahmoudieh for our men's
knapsacks, squadbags, and baggage; and while the
lubberly Believers, who formed the crew of that
imperial steamer, were endeavouring, with all the force
of their paddles, engines, and hawser, to drag the
yacht into deep water when the tide flowed, Jack was
quietly seated in the cabin&mdash;about a month after all
these troubles&mdash;beside Fanny at the piano, turning
over the leaves of her music, and gazing sentimentally
on her glossy tresses and white hands, while she
warbled away, and in a low voice told him how 'she
dared not seek to offer him, a timid love like hers;'
till our matter-of-fact Jack was quite overcome, and
the merry Fanny, already recovering from the shock
of late events, was filled with laughter at the triumph
of her own beauty, and the success of her brilliant
coquetry.
</p>

<p>
She had already forgotten poor Snobleigh, who,
after doing his duty bravely in the trenches before
the Sedan, was found one morning cold and stiff,
with his sword and a half-finished cigar beside him.
He had been slain in the night by the splinter of
a 'whistling-dick,' <i>i.e.</i>, a ten-inch shell, and was
now taking his eternal rest with the gallant Blair,
and eleven other officers of the Household Brigade,
on Cathcart's Hill.
</p>

<p>
At last the yacht was got fairly afloat, and was
anchored in the stream.  Her sails were bent anew,
her running rigging rove, and the testy old baronet
longed for the time that should find him under weigh
to lay his grievances personally before our ambassador.
</p>

<p>
Beating against a head-wind, that blew straight
from the Bosphorus, the <i>Fairy Bell</i> was close-hauled
on the starboard tack.  It was evening now; the
wind was light; a warm glow bathed all the shore,
and tinted with amber and crimson the waves that
rolled upon the beach from Ogia to the Point of
St. Stephen.
</p>

<p>
I had been insensible, or weak and dozing, for
many days and many nights&mdash;in short, I must have
been feverish and delirious for some time previous;
and on this evening, when the cool sea-breeze from
the open cabin-window fanned my cheek, and the
bright waves ran merrily past in the setting
sunshine, I first became aware of existence; the painful
phantasmagoria of sickness passed away, and I felt
conscious of the rippling water, the warm sun, and
the flowers that stood in vases near me.  I had
dreams of Laura Everingham, and of her pretty face
prying into mine&mdash;that face, the soft features of
which were almost fading from my memory like a
dream of other years.  I remembered sounds of music
that had come to me in sleep; soft perfumed hands
that had touched me; subdued lights, and whispering
voices, and then long, dull, and monotonous silences.
I started and awoke to life!  Laura's well-remembered
voice was in my ear, and speaking to me&mdash;every
accent was painfully yet delightfully distinct.
</p>

<p>
The voice of Laura&mdash;could it be?  Was the tender
memory of Iola&mdash;were all the events of the past
year&mdash;but a dream?  Or was the hope that had
brightened other days coming back to me again?
</p>

<p>
Who has not felt the nameless, the indescribable
thrill, amounting almost to a pang of joy, that shoots
through the heart after a long, and it might be,
hopeless separation, when the old familiar voice of one
beloved&mdash;a friend, relation, or lover falls upon the
ear?
</p>

<p>
I drew back the curtain&mdash;there was a light step on
the carpet; a little hand was placed in mine, and
two blue eyes looked kindly and tenderly on my
face with a sad smile, such as Laura alone could
give.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Laura!' I whispered, in a breathless voice, 'I
have suffered much&mdash;very much since we last met.'
</p>

<p>
'And I, too, have suffered,' said she, weeping.
</p>

<p>
'You?&mdash;oh&mdash;I remember now.' I added, pressing
a hand upon my brow, and endeavouring to rally all
my thoughts; 'did not some one die&mdash;and then we
had some fighting?'
</p>

<p>
But my brain became giddy and I closed my eyes,
yet I still felt the pressure of Laura's little hand, as
it lay trembling in mine.  My heart vibrated to its
pulses, for in this there was a dangerous and alluring
novelty that bewildered me.  Sleep seemed to come
upon me again, and of that interview I remember no
more.
</p>

<p>
Again it was evening, and the sun, as he set behind
the faint blue hills of Roumelia, shed a blaze of yellow
glory over the vast extent of Constantinople, gilding
its embattled towers, its tall white galleried minarets,
topped with glittering crescents, its gilded domes of
dazzling brightness, and its dense masses of terraced
roofs, filling every casement apparently with lamps
of burnished gold.  The green foliage of the Seraglio
Garden and of the Prince's Island; the white walls
of Scutari, the strong tower of Galata, Pera, the
residence of the Franks, were all sparkling in light;
and the forest of masts and gay ensigns that crowded
the Golden Horn seemed to be countless as the light
caiques that shot over the ripples of the Bosphorus.
</p>

<p>
Long and black rows of cypresses cast their
shadows to the east, lengthening, as the sun departs;
then, hark! the red evening guns peal from the
strong tower of the Seraskier; the ships of war
reply, and the muezzins, from a thousand mosques,
shout the shrill cry 'to prayer!' while over tower
and temple, cypress-grove and guarded ship, over the
Seven Towers, the giant façade of the Seraglio, and
over all the sparkling sea the sunlight dies away.
</p>

<p>
We were at anchor off the city, and stretched upon
a cushioned sofa, I gazed languidly at all this from
the stern windows, as the yacht swung round with
the stream.
</p>

<p>
Laura was beside me; Sir Horace had gone ashore
to confer with the ambassador; Fanny was with
Jack Belton in the outer cabin, as the tinkling of a
piano informed me&mdash;and, as Laura timidly seated
herself by my side, Callum Dhu, my constant, my
kind and faithful attendant, retired on deck.
</p>

<p>
I felt happy; for after a separation so long and so
hopeless, and having the certainty of a separation
before us again, to be with her was to enjoy perfect
happiness.
</p>

<p>
'Laura,' said I, 'I feel as if in a dream&mdash;while
addressing you, and when uttering your name.'
</p>

<p>
'A dream?'
</p>

<p>
'From which I fear to waken.'
</p>

<p>
'Dream on, then, dear Allan, if it delights you.'
</p>

<p>
'My life at home was all an agony of suspense and
continued mortifications, even while hope, however
faint and slender, lasted; but how shall I describe
the torture that life became, after hope itself faded
away, and I lost you&mdash;lost you for ever!'
</p>

<p>
Laura answered only with her tears, and a long
pause, filled up by tender smiles and mute caressing
glances or a pressure of the hand ensued.  All was
forgiven and forgotten.
</p>

<p>
My letter from Dumbarton she had <i>never received</i>.
So this imaginary neglect, which had stung me so
deeply, was at once explained away.
</p>

<p>
And what of poor Iola?  Was my love for her
forgotten quite?
</p>

<p>
Here, in my own extenuation, I cannot do better
than quote a paragraph from one of the most pleasing
of our female writers&mdash;one alike charming for the
brilliancy of her style and the beauty of her person,
when referring to a man's first and other loves:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'He spoke no more than truth when he told you
that you were his ideal of love and loveliness.  The
woman who is so beloved may have successors, as she
may have had predecessors; but rivals&mdash;properly so
called&mdash;she can have none.  Lone and different as
the moon in a heaven full of stars, she remains in the
world of that man's heart.  He has known other
women and he has known HER.  It may be the love
of his youth, or the wife of his old age&mdash;first love, or
last love&mdash;it matters not.  <i>The</i> love&mdash;the one love
that fulfils all the exigencies of illusion, all the
charms of sense, and all the pleasures of companionship,
comes but <i>once</i> in a man's life-time.  The rest
are substitutes, make-shifts for love.  To them in vain
he shall affirm or deny that which they desire or
dread to hear.  In his heart a shadow sits enthroned,
who for ever bends down to listen&mdash;to watch those
who would approach him&mdash;and bar them out, with
whispers of sorrowful comparison, and the delight of
remembered days.'
</p>

<p>
During my passion for Iola I believed that Laura's
marriage had freed me from every tie to <i>her</i>&mdash;a bitter
freedom certainly.
</p>

<p>
The story of Clavering's horrid fate had been told
to her long since by Jack Belton, and on my recovery,
her natural sorrow was one of the first things that
piqued and galled me, the more so as poor Tom's
miniature, done in Thorburn's best style, seemed to
be constantly winking at me out of a brooch on
Laura's breast.  I referred to this, and she gave me
a sad smile.
</p>

<p>
'Poor Clavering was well worthy of all my esteem,'
said she; '<i>that</i> sentiment he possessed to the full,
Allan, but my love&mdash;never!  Oh, never! for it was
yours, and yours only, dear Allan,' she added,
sobbing on my shoulder.  'He knew that he possessed
my purest esteem when he married me, and hoped
that love would follow the marriage into which papa's
impetuosity hurried me&mdash;a vain and too often a
wicked hope.  Advised by some, cajoled by others,
quizzed by a few, seriously urged by the many, and
overawed by papa, I consented to become his wife,
and no time was given for reflecting or retracting.
You were lost to me, and other love I had none; so
the day came at last which was to make your Laura
Everingham his Laura Clavering&mdash;the fatal day came
and the hour!  The vows were said; the mute assent
was given; <i>this</i> gold ring was placed upon my
finger&mdash;there was a kissing of friends to undergo&mdash;a murmur
of voices, and a hum of congratulation.  I heard the
marriage-bells jangling overhead and felt myself lifted
into a carriage.  I had fainted, and remember no
more of that day&mdash;but that poor Clavering was all
tenderness and kindness.'
</p>

<p>
I sighed bitterly at this description; and then felt
something of joy and triumph as Laura placed her
cheek caressingly to mine, while with her sweet eyes
the very sunshine seemed to brighten as she smiled
with the same smile that first shed a light upon my
path in life, and taught me that I had a heart to lose.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, Laura,' I exclaimed, 'I have but one request
to make of heaven.'
</p>

<p>
'And it is&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'That you will love me as of old.'
</p>

<p>
'Dearest Allan, my heart never wavered in its love
for you; though my affections were forced upon
another, my soul was ever with you.  Take courage,
Allan, you will soon recover, and all will yet be
well.'
</p>

<p>
'I have no wish to recover!' I exclaimed, with a
sudden burst of renewed bitterness.
</p>

<p>
'Allan!'
</p>

<p>
'None.  I wish that Zahroun's shot had pierced
my heart; I can never win you, for your father hates
me, and will never consent to our marriage!'
</p>

<p>
'<i>He does not hate you</i>, my dear boy,' exclaimed the
hearty voice of old Sir Horace, as he started forward
from a corner of the cabin, where he had been for
some time an unknown observer of this scene; 'he
does not hate you&mdash;but he loves and regards you, as
you deserve to be loved and regarded, for he owes
you a debt of eternal gratitude; he owes you life
and more than life&mdash;the safety and honour of his
dear little Laura.  Take her, Allan Mac Innon, and
with her take your old ancestral glen, wood and
water, rock and mountain&mdash;and may God bless you
both, and make you happy as you deserve to be!'

<h3>
CHAPTER XL.
<br /><br />
FAREWELL.
</h3>

<p>
After the interesting tableau with which the last
chapter concludes, the reader may consider that to
say more were a useless task; but there are others
in this narrative for whom I trust he&mdash;or she&mdash;may
have conceived a little affection as well as for myself.
</p>

<p>
My friend, Jack Belton, was excellent at all manner
of flirtation, and had an inimitable way of hanging
sentimentally over a believing young lady's chair, and
quoting Byron, or even Shelly, and giving her to
know with all point and tenderness how, if
</p>

<p class="poem">
  '&mdash;&mdash;the sunbeams kiss the earth,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the moonbeams kiss the sea,<br />
  What are all these kissings worth,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If <i>thou</i> kiss not <i>me</i>?'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And Jack was always sketching or copying music
for the girls about the garrison&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, making the
band-master do so, and passing it off&mdash;like a rogue
as he was&mdash;for his own.  He was dazzled by Fanny
Clavering; but his surprise and chagrin were great,
to find that, when promenading the deck, she was
quite as much enchanted with her old friend Callum
Dhu as with himself.
</p>

<p>
'A private!' muttered Jack, stroking his bandolined
moustache; 'demme, the girl's mad!'
</p>

<p>
After a time, he discovered that she was more than
a match for him&mdash;a perfect flirt, who knew the
language of the <i>fan</i>, as well as any girl of Cadiz or
Almeria.
</p>

<p>
In the evenings when they sat on the deck, viewing
the scenery of the Bosphorus, Jack was always
by Fanny's side, watching her bright and beautiful
face, and her sparkling eyes, that glanced waggishly
upward, from under the prettiest of pink parasols
with a long wavy fringe.  Here would this coquettish
Fanny deal her battery of smiling shots and wicked
shells alternately at Jack Belton and my Highland
follower, whom on some cunning pretence or other
she contrived to keep pretty constantly about her;
and on whom, to the unbounded wrath of Jack, she
gave the especial care of her little Maltese spaniel&mdash;a
silky-haired and Lillyputian cur, with a pug nose, a
snappish eye, a silver collar and bell, all being the
parting gift of some forgotten lover in the Rifles at
Valetta.
</p>

<p>
Seated thus, with Jack by her side, and the handsome
'Callum in attendance,' as she phrased it,
Fanny would speak to the latter of his home, of the
Highlands, of Glen Ora, and poor Callum's honest
heart was so completely won, that the memory of his
dead Minnie was forgotten.  He could have
worshipped this beautiful English lady who knew so
much about the clans and of other times, when that
oppression of the poor, which now crieth to God for
vengeance, was unknown in the land of the Gael;
and who said so many kind and bewildering things
to him; and though his plainness, his honesty, and
manliness gained her respect&mdash;even as the heavy
debt she owed him won her gratitude&mdash;his handsome
face and noble figure, with his sincere eye and
respectful manner, made so favourable an impression
on the brilliant Fanny, that though making in her
little heart, a vow for the thousandth time, not to
coquette with the poor private soldier, she could
not resist it; and the end of it all was, that the biter
was bitten; for the dazzling Fanny fell in love with
my henchman, even as the friend of my "Lady Lee,"
the proud and imperious Orelia Payne, did with her
corporal of Dragoons.
</p>

<p>
Though a coarse red coat covered the broad breast
of Callum Dhu, Fanny felt all his sterling worth,
over the artificial flutterers who had surrounded her
so long; and his superior officer, the fashionable
Jack Belton, informed me with undisguised chagrin,
'that while my demmed fellow was present on deck,
Miss Clavering seemed to have eyes for no one else.'
</p>

<p>
The end of all this coquetting, promenading,
piano-playing, and music-turning, et cetera was, that our
lively flirt consented one evening to become the
lawful spouse of John Belton, Esq., of Her Majesty's
&mdash;th Highlanders, but&mdash;after secretly pounding
enough out of her many thousands to buy her Celtic
lover a commission in the Turkish contingent&mdash;she
levanted before daybreak, and was privately married
at the chapel of the British Embassy to&mdash;<i>Callum
Dhu</i>!
</p>

<p>
This little mésalliance rather soured Sir Horace,
and intensely disgusted Jack, who quite forgot the
fag-end of his mess-room ditty, <i>anent</i> being 'sad
about trifles,' and started in a rage to join our first
battalion at Balaclava.
</p>

<p>
I have procured sick-leave, as the doctors aver that
the devil of a bullet made such a hole in my side
that nothing will close or cure it but my native
Highland air.
</p>

<p>
I am to return home&mdash;home to Glen Ora in the
<i>Fairy Bell</i>, the yacht of Sir Horace, and <i>we</i> are to be
married in due time after our arrival; for the worthy
baronet, after mature consideration, was pleased to
reiterate his consent, without apparently caring a jot
about what that bugbear 'the world,' would say.
</p>

<p>
The old M.P. had met this personage&mdash;'the world,'
in Parliament, and in the borough for which he is
Member; he had met him at Almack's; at Crockford's;
at Véry's; at the Opera; at Meurice's in
Paris, and he marvelled in secret what this awful
inquisitor, whose whereabouts is so dangerously vague,
would say to the fact of his only daughter and heiress
not becoming the wife of any of the <i>blasé</i> Honourables
or sporting Peers to whom gossip had alternately
assigned her; but simply plain Mrs. Allan Mac Innon,
the wife of a hero, with only Her Majesty's 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
per diem.
</p>

<p>
He took another glass of Moselle; pondered a
little, and thought it was all for the best.
</p>

<p>
And so think I!  With Laura for my bride, I would
not envy Alexander of all the Russias on his throne.
</p>

<p>
The hearths of the people shall again be lit in
Glen Ora; from the wilds of the Far West I will call
the survivors home; and there, at least, the image of
God shall no longer give place to grouse and deer&mdash;to
sheep and dogs!
</p>

<p>
Reality never equalled anticipation, say casuists
and moralists; but those fellows seldom smell
gunpowder, and moreover never saw, never loved or
were beloved by such a girl as Laura Everingham.

the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
